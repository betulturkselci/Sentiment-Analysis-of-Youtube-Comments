"I for one was really looking forward to seeing the slow corruption of the Numenorean rulers, having immortality playing on their minds from watching the Elves and each season we see a ruler die but with every new season we see the corruption take one more step towards the fall of Numenor. The fact that the show-runners said â€œWell we had to compress the timeline or else most of our human characters would be dying each seasonâ€â€¦ Thatâ€™s the whole point! Again just feels like a wasted opportunity to do something really interesting and different and I really think that could have been one of itâ€™s biggest selling points."
Just watched the LOTR trilogy since it first came out. Now watching the Hobbit trilogy for the first time. Can't wait for this!
The fact John Howe is the concept Artist of the show gives some hope.

"Â @brandon lawrenceÂ  If you have the time yeah, I do think you get a conclusive segment in the extenders ones you wouldn't get otherwise, but honestly you could probably read the books in the same amount of time"
Wow this is such a waste of time for everyone involved. What a shame.

Last time I checked I thought there was over 1.5 million dislikes.... this series is going to absolute trash... the creators should probably call it quits before wasting another billion
Each comment you remove brings you closer to putting the ring on your finger.
Wtf
"For those confused on why last month this video had 3 million dislikes and now it only has half that:

If you're using the show YouTube dislikes extension, then you have to understand that extension doesn't actually know the real number of dislikes, because the dislike data has been removed from YouTube's API. It can only make an estimation, which I assume is done by taking the ratio of dislikes of people using the extension and then using that ratio along with the actual like count to produce the number of dislikes.

For example, if you have 3 real likes, 1 extension like (1 person using the extension, 2 people not) and 1,000,000 extension dislikes, then the calculated number of dislikes is 3,000,000. But if the number of extension likes increases by one to make it 2 extension likes and 1,000,000 extension dislikes, then the calculated number of dislikes is 1,500,000."

Â @DamienÂ  Capitalism shapes the government.
I would rather say that neo-marxism infiltrated capitalism in this case.
"Â @W. KirchhuegelÂ  There is no neo marxism , marxism is based on existance of only working class. Today we a paying the price of making rich richer."
Â @W. KirchhuegelÂ  There is only one marxism and it is marxism..
its not about money. Jeff has plenty of it to lose
They deleted my dislike 3 months ago. I had to do it again today. I'll check again in a few months.
Thank you for the exact number.
Â @Lil FishÂ Lol no problem.
hhahaha true but amazon cares less. It was the first hobbit and she was the first gay also diversity at its best hahahaha
Â @Zan ZakÂ  they missed their chance to make her black too for shame amazon for shame
Elves were described by Tolkien himself to be light skinned. Also what about the hobbit at 0:15 do you care to explain that?
"Â @Santiago LopezÂ  Elves were never collectively described this way. Also the Hobbit (or rather Harfoot) shown there is not dark skinned. Look up the actress who plays her. But even if she was, the Harfoots were described as having darker skin than other Hobbits, so it would still fit."
"Â @LasernatooÂ  The issue isn't with the casting of a black actor as an elf.

The reasons people dislike this are far more numerous 

 But since you say they were never described this way, i can think of at least one instance in the forgotten tales were an elf is described to have pale gray skin after living undet the mountains ""unlike all of his kin, who have fair skin"""
"Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  I think you're thinking of Meglin from the Book of Lost Tales, who was described as 'swart', the same word used to describe the Haradrim. ""Less fair was he than most of his kindly folk, swart and of none too kindly mood"". So this is really just another point towards darker skinned elves being possible in Tolkien's world."
Â @LasernatooÂ  I don't think i am
Â @LasernatooÂ  Lol the only swart elf was evil haha
"Â @Pablito123Â  based tolkien, lmao"
Â @LasernatooÂ  Swart is different than black / sub saharan african. Why cant americans understand the difference?
"Â @HÃºrin ThalionÂ  yep, swart could be described a person with dark hair and eyes that got tanned."
"Â @HÃºrin ThalionÂ  Swart can and has been used to describe sub-Saharan African people. People don't see to have any problem accepting the Haradrim as black when they're described as swart, so why is this different?"
Â @Pablito123Â  This isn't the comeback you think it is bro
"Â @LasernatooÂ  No I mean, can you make sense of why there is a hobbit existing when they're not supposed to exist in that age?"
"Â @Santiago LopezÂ  They did exist in the Second Age, they just weren't recorded in history. â€œThe beginning of Hobbits lies far back in the Elder Days that are now lost and forgotten. Only the Elves still preserve any records of that vanished time, and their traditions are concerned almost entirely with their own history, in which Men appear seldom and Hobbits are not mentioned at all."""
"Also technically those shown in this show aren't Hobbits but rather Harfoots, ancestors of Hobbits. Hobbits that are part of the Harfoot breed still exist in the Third Age though."
"Â @LasernatooÂ  Maeglin is also later described in the Silm as:

""As Maeglin grew to full stature he resembled in face and form rather his kindred of the Noldor, but in mood and mind he was the son of his father. His words were few save in matters that touched him near, and then his voice had a power to move those that heard him and to overthrow those that withstood him. He was tall and black-haired; his eyes were dark, yet bright and keen as the eyes of the Noldor; and his skin was white.""


His skin was white."
"Â @MaedhrosÂ  I never said his skin wasn't white in the Silm. I was responding to someone else who was describing an elf from the Book of Lost Tales. All it shows is that we have had a non-white elf in the legendarium before, even if it's not canon."
"Â @LasernatooÂ  Yeah, I know. I was just clearing up any misconceptions for anyone else thinking Maeglin wasn't white, in the end.

I do not believe there is any basis for black Elves. All three initial clans were white, and even if some migrated South (the text only notes them going West and mingling with other Elves), I doubt they survived long given Morgoth's influence. And if some did... I don't see enough time to develop dark pigmentation, given Elves breed slower than Men. And cross-breeding with dark skinned Men would result in Mannish offspring (like Dior) - not Elven."
"My take:  1) Arondir is one black elf, with a modern fade haircut, and (so far) no context for why he differs from the other elves.  In the absence of further information, it's immersion-breaking on at least two levels.  2) Look up ""Elf"" on Wikipedia and scroll down to the etymology section.  Then ask yourself if Tolkien, a philologist, was not aware of that etymology."
"Â @LasernatooÂ  ""Harfoot breed?""  You haven't read Sir Lenny Henry's description of Harfoots?"
"Â @MaedhrosÂ  The text also mentions the Nandor (ancestors of the Silvan) migrating south to the mouths of the Anduin, which is separated from Harad by the Bay of Belfalas. They did this during the Years of the Trees, however it remains to be seen whether Amazon will use Tolkien's later idea of the Sun and Moon having existed far earlier (as well as Arda being round from the start) or not. If so, the Nandor could've crossed the bay and potentially had thousands of years to develop darker skin, which certainly seems like enough time, considering the Men in the First Age developed a wide range of skin colors in <500 years."
"Â @LasernatooÂ  I was referring to the Nandor. As you said, the furthest known travels isn't really that far. IF they travelled further, and weren't slain or captured, I still don't see pigment working.

Tolkien was reworking timelines specifically to give Men more time to develop. (And again, Elves breed slower... so the generation-evolution would be far harder to happen so quickly).

I think multiple hurders have to be jumped to justify black Elves (which kind of defeats the etymology behind them too).

(Amazon should use the Trees, and not the Sun always existing - we have a promo image of them, albeit dead)"

"I like to order stuff from amazon because many times they sell quality products a lot cheaper than most and the customer service has been ok and deliveries fast. That is what they should remain, selling products. Their games suck and their films and series will suck too. Too bad that they are now going to totally ruin something so pure and fantastic as Tolkiens middle-earth tales. Not only will they ruin it, but they will implement loads of false stuff and bullshit into it under the name and tales of middle-earth and Tolkien. This will be a total disgrace."

"Black elves, black Anna Boleyn.......  I think that it's time to make a film about Martin Luther King with white actor, or it will be racism?"
"â€¢ No, I definitely don't like the trailer, I think Amazon should definitely make some changes, otherwise this series is going to be a total failure. They could delay the premiere of the series to 2023, and take the project in stride, why? Because I think most Tolkien fans and non-fans aren't going to like it. Today we have the great opportunity to have tools like these, which are comments on YouTube and social networks, if something as simple as that, and Amazon should be attentive to what most people think and although many Sometimes criticism is uncomfortable and even painful, it is always good to take it into account when it is done from a constructive point of view. As a great fan of Tolkien that I am, I would like to leave my humble opinion in the most constructive and respectful way possible, of what I would like to see in the series, because I know that it is not an easy job to interpret Tolkien's work at an audiovisual level and thank Amazon even if I didn't like the series why? For giving me the great opportunity to see one of my dreams come true, I always wondered if in the future there would be the possibility of adapting or finishing the stories that Tolkien left unfinished, whether in books, movies and series, I always wondered if not. there were creative and brilliant contemporary writers or screenwriters, so they will tell us their version of the unfinished stories of middle earth, but at the same time all lovers of their work should participate, through comments and criticism , while it is developing and we all build something spectacular, well without further ado, here is my version of how I think the visual aspect of the series should be and for which audience it should be directed.
###1.- CGI the whole series should be in CGI like Avatar, even the orc humans and everything .....and why is this? .because it would not generate that problem when you put a dragon made in CGI next to a flesh and blood actor it would look better visually, since no matter how well the CGI is achieved, that small contrast is always noticeable, of what is made by computer than not, in this way we could avoid this small problem by passing the entire series to digital format or CGI, in addition this gives the director greater maneuverability when capturing his idea, because he has greater control of the atmosphere and atmosphere that you want to give to each scene, you just have to see the War Craft cinematics or trailers and compare them with the movie, the cinematics and trailer are much more epic and atmospheric than the War Craft movie itself and I think the mistake One of the producers of this movie was that they didn't make a two-hour cinematic or video game trailer, all in CGI instead of the movie they did. Another example is The Wicher, the series is fine, but I definitely prefer the video game trailers, they are much more impressive! .And finally, from The Elder Scrolls, the video game trailers are definitely great, it just needs a little more realism to deceive the human eye, James Cameron is getting very close to it with Avatar 2. Why does Amazon not take advantage of this opportunity and offer also a new and different product to the public. Amazon should invest in ULTRA-REALISTIC CGI technologies and produce series and movies of a visual quality far from the reach of its competitors, there is the strong point of Amazon, because they have the logistical and economic resources to do what the vast majority of their competitors of stringing do not have $.
,###2 I think that the series should be aimed at an adult audience and not for children, nobody wants to see Narnia 4.0 they should not be limited to violent, gory and sexual scenes the second age was much darker violent and epic, there is only to remember the way in which Celebrimbor is killed by Sauron impaled on a stake after having tortured him, a clear allusion to Vlad III Dracula of our world, an ideal model to mold Sauron's personality, I want the orcs to transmit fear, terror
that they are ruthless cruel and brutal They should hire people who are experts in suspense and terror to direct the scenes with them, and in this way get a contrast with the most benevolent beings of middle earth, and of course great battles, wars and colossal and brutal fights . Well those are some of the things I would like to see in the series, Thanks Amazon."

Go back to the shadows Amazon!"
Gonna be a big pile of garbage

Yrch!
"Take a page out of ""the boys"" playbook. Testosterone and violence sells......and money talks!"
"I weirdly can't tell if this is a trolling comment. Because Tolkien never wrote ""dark, violent and Gritty"" work, his work was originally written for his children when they were young, and the lord of the rings trilogy was rated PG (Parental Guidance) by the bbfc in England. Secondly just because a company can write in game stories, it doesn't necessarily translate to films. Even then you can look at the game Skyrim which embodied the phrase ""broad as an ocean, deep as a puddle"". Finally CGI should be used with caution as I believe Ian McKellen cried when having to use to much green screen when filming"
"Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  Tolkien never wrote dark, violent and gritty? You've not read Tolkien then. The Hobbit was the only book written for his children. LOTR has some clear cases of violence (severed heads launched into Minas Tirith, for instance). The First Age includes everything from gory violence, to incest. Plenty of trauma to be had - immense darkness and horror at times."

wait im confuse why everyone is hating i don't know anything bout this trilogy
so trash
"Why you deleting all the comments? It was over 80k,now it's just 46k. Are Amazon Studios in panic mode?"
It sounds like some disney princess non-sense written for 4 year old girls
Nope
"Hit us with your Tolkien wisdom, oh mighty shill."
"I am glad that your more informed post stuck to name calling and insults rather than facts and solid arguments; this is a sure sign of mental and moral superiority.  Sadly, it appears there are a lot more ''fake fans'' and ''whiny brats'' than know-it-all shills."
The fact you don't know there is more information about this mess out there then just this trailer is in itself worrying.
Â @The Other TedÂ  Teeeed!!! They erased your comments from my comment :(
"Â @Sobrevivir para ContarlaÂ  If you mean ""TheOtherTed"" (no spaces), that account has fallen into shadow..."
"I am curious, are you really not aware of all the information out there to base my opinion from? or are you just a disingenuous shill?"
"its not just a few images: its an entire trailer with uninspiring music and childish narnia voice over, its images of 2 of literature's most famous characters Galadriel and Elrond looking out of character, its images of made up characters foreshading made up storylines in probably the worlds most detailed and storied rich universe, (the result of buying the rights to the wrong books) and above all it is the most condescending attitude when questioning this."
lmao ratioed
Witcher will go down as a masterpiece compare with this abomination
I didn't even watch s2 I watched s1 and that was enough pain for me
"One month ago there were 3 million,YouTube deleted 1.5 m  dislikes"
They don't respect Tolkiens work. They are rewriting the timeline. They are changing characters. They are not portraying races such as elves and dwarves as Tolkien described them. Dwarven women have beards. Elves have pale skin. There was no hobbits during this part in the timeline. They don't care about any of Tolkiens work and are just using his name to sell their series which is basically bad fanfiction. There is so much source material and they do this because they don't care about Lord of the Rings.
"this isn't a trilogy. its  a tv show.
its related to a trilogy of movies, not being set in the same canon universe as them but inspired by them so sort of a spiritual prequel but not. it is a tv showed based on the appendixes of a trilogy with alot of made up stuff to pad it out.
but if you didn't know anything about it, how did you know there was a trilogy?"
Â @d woodÂ  because I've seen it  on commercials and when the first I saw it I assumed that it has a trilogy
"Keep Lord of the Rings out of your mouth; this is Amazon's The Rings of Power, and this is how I will continue to refer to it as."
"The sad thing is that whoever wins, the dark lord Amazon or us Men of the West, it will be the end of Middle Earth as we know it"
"""Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have not passed through fir and death to bandi  crooked words with a witless worm."" - Tolkien"
reading the comments i actually dont know what people are upset about. is it really just the black elf?
Why is the audio so shitty when she says â€œI can feel itâ€ it sounds so distorted
This is going to suck so bad.
"Can't wait for this to come out... So I can have a 24 hour binge of the original Peter Jackson trilogy.

I might even live stream myself on the release date of your new show... watching the original trilogy movies.

Might even make some money from it myself. Aways wanted to give streaming ago.

Thanks amazon."
I had no idea what this show was supposed to be until I scrolled down to the comments. omg. teach me to click on YouTube recommendations.
"Ah yes, removing comments and dislikes. How magnanimous of you Amazon."
"â€œThere is no curse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of Men for this treachery.â€ â€• J.R.R. Tolkien"
"1,6 million dislikes ! ""And this is a good thing !!!"""
What jrr tolkien book is this series based on?
Us real fans of Middle Earth and Tolkien should honor his legacy and watch The LOTR Trilogy the same day The Rings of Trash comes out and post it over social media for other Tolkien fans to do the same. Let's keep rubbing it in their faces of trash this series is going to be.
"115K Likes - 1.6M Dislikes (That's a 1.5M dislike increase in 3 months!)
As of 16/05/2022

Also, Amazon is deleting dislikes.
Also, Amazon is deleting comments.
Also, Amazon deleted my 2 month update."
"1.6 million dislikes isn't enough, so here's another."
"""And he never forgave... and he never forgot."""
"""The canons of narrative in any medium cannot be wholly different; and the failure of poor films is often precisely in exaggeration, and in the intrusion of unwarranted matter owing to not perceiving where the core of the original lies."" JRR Tolkien"
Has this garbage been canceled yet?
"This gives me Narnia vibes. Srsly the production style gives off such a ""Chronicles of Narnia"" vibe"
"currently 1.6 million dislikes that were hidden ""for the small creators"""
"No... It's a part of it because he shouldn't exist within the lore but it is far from the only thing or even the main thing, Wizards being introduced 2,000 years ahead of schedule is one, Galadriel being a warrior rather then the wise powerful Elf she was etc etc, it's a fairly long list."
"It's probably due to the fact that Youtube has deleted most of the comments that had the complaints in them. Black elf is 1 small part of the dislike. Beardless female dwarf is another (female dwarves have beards in the book and the movie version, they don't in this one). Hobbits in the 2nd age, ruining established characters like Galadriel and Elrond by completely changing their characteristics, personality, etc..
Comments made about this series in a vanity fair article explaining their plans for the series upset people the most. The fact that Amazon has already ruined a similarly good fantasy book series called the Wheel of Time by making similar changes from book version to tv version. Those are the complaints that I can remember off of the top of my head."
it's not
"It's supposedly set in the Second Age, but all Amazon can use are the appendices to the Lord of the Rings books.  If you want books with more detail on the time frame, check out Christopher Tolkien's books - The Silmarillion, The Unfinished Tales, and The History of Middle-Earth (a 12-book series).  Warning - they're a bit dry and scholarly."
This completely destroys the lore.
"You have a book. and you need just FOLLOW the book . But, of course, it is better for you to create short-hair elves and dwarfes without beards. Do you know that for elves in the universe of Tolkien the beauty of hair and hairstyles was very important? ""it was the hair of extraordinary beauty that they considered the most attractive feature"" and all elves tried to had long hair because of this fact. 
And for the dwarfes, even women, long beard is the sign of their honor and beauty. if you do not have long and beautiful beard, it means that you are not an attractive dwarf
I SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THE FILMS AND HAVE NEVER READ THE 
BOOKS OF TOLKIEN OR HOW COULD YOU CREATED THIS STRANGE SERIES?
YOU JUST DO NOT RESPECT TOLKIEN AND HIS WORKS."
"this is textbook marxist garbage 
the ONLY reason people are talking about this positively is because you fucking bribed them, I'd rather flush money down the toilet which would be the same thing as paying for this C R A P

also I wonder how many bots they have liking this 115k seems a little bit TOO MUCH 
dislikes are past a M I L L I O N by the way"
WTF is this dogshit??? a love movie??? this is NOT the LOTR i loved and watched
Well... I think I've just been cured of my Game of Thrones ptsd
The look of the trailer is good ... until they talk.

ridiculous

No matter how hard Amazon and all it's shills try, this will never be or have anything to do with "" The Lord Of The Rings"", ""The Hobbit"", JRR Tolkien or his work. This monstrosity, is just an empty, meaningless, creatively bankrupt and souless creation. Shame on you! ğŸ‘ğŸ‘"
This is NOT lotr
The level of cringe is outstanding. this is so bad...
Might cancel my prime membership after this garbage.
Garbage
What are you waiting for?
i cancelled mine after this garbage
"I find Amazons treatment of Tolkien, his works, and his fans to be genuinely offensive"
looks fkn terrible
"Hold your ground! Hold your ground!
Sons of Tolkien, of Jackson, my brothers,
I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me.
A day may come when the courage of the fans fails,
when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship,
but it is not this day.
An hour of wolves and shattered shields,
when the age of Tolkien comes crashing down,
but it is not this day!
This day we fight!!
By all that you hold dear on this good Earth,
I bid you stand, Fans of Tolkien!!!"
"1.6 million dislikes??? Dang, that's tough."
Watching this trailer gives me the same feeling as hearing my cat gagging somewhere just out of sight.
I will stick to the books and Peter Jackson work not this pile of excrement. Tolkien will be turning in his grave!!
We fans need to destroy this abomination with every ounce of energy we can muster.  MAKE IT FAIL!!!
They removing dislikes lol. You mess with the wrong fandom Amazon!!!
"â€œThere is no curse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of Men for this treachery.â€ J.R.R. Tolkien"
Just sad Tolkien would despise this show. The destruction of his world is a loss for all.

"Looks fantastic and very true to Peter Jacksons work. No doubt many who worked on his movies were hired by Prime Video. I like the idea with dark skinned elves, since elven life span gives each of them much more time to travel and settle down in all corners of the world. As for Galadriel looking like a potent adventurer, it seems necessary as she's to become the supreme queen of the elves one day."

...Arwen?
Â @The Other TedÂ  Galadriel x/
nice bait.
Â @HÃºrin ThalionÂ  yeah Arwen is pretty hot
That isn't how evolution or medieval migration works but OK lol
Â @DelogrosÂ  *worked
Â @asdfÂ  You think evolution is all finished now do you? Well that's an interesting scientific theory if nothing else LOL
"Â @DelogrosÂ  ^^ for a species in which each generation lives for thousands of years... yeah, finished enough for my points to be valid!"
Â @asdfÂ  You understand that evolution works best in short lived species... right? :S It would take a bunch of elves living in the Africa of Middle Earth 100 times longer to evolve melanin (or some version of) etc then it would take humans... Black people don't just have really impressive tans :D
"Â @DelogrosÂ  yesh, Elves=/= good evolution arguments. Elven migration patterns=/= good target for said evolution arguments.
Elven life span= crucial for LOTS of backpacking and mixing with all the worlds natives."
Â @DelogrosÂ  missed the melanin point you made- obviously all elves were blacks in the beginning :) and took a good while evolving into whites
"Â @asdfÂ  Elves don't mix with the natives, in all of the second and third age it happened 3 times so that argument is out the window before you even start... OOOOHHHH I see your just ignorant of the genealogy involved in middle Earth, well that explains it, there are several good books on the subject by the creator of the world if you actually wanna try and get this stuff right one day... though I doubt it I feel I should at least mention these resources exist. You don't have to actually make it up all the work was already done for you, trust me, far better then you will ever manage in 20 lifetimes of trying.

As for your general argument 1) Elves live a long time, mutations do not happen in the weird way you seem to think they do.
2) There are few Elven migration patterns that would take them into the undesirable (for an elf) wastelands South and East of Mordor, It's like suggesting Dwarfs would intentionally live above ground in a rain-forest it's just a silly argument.
3) Well I've covered the natives, so rare there are songs for the few times it happened
4) nope Elves have always been white since they first came to middle Earth, sorry not sorry :D"
"Â @DelogrosÂ  quite an expansive lore there no doubt, but I don't mind that logical reasoning arround elven evolution- and interest for travel- road kills some of Tolkiens whims."
Â @asdfÂ  are you jewish by any chance?
Â @HÃºrin ThalionÂ  what do you know about jews?
"Â @asdfÂ  only a music band in Tel Aviv called the ""Dancing Israelis""."
Â @HÃºrin ThalionÂ  why ask?
As a physically handicapped man I demand representation among the elves. Even though theyâ€™re not human. Otherwise you are definitely anapirophobes (fear of handicapped)
What a nightmare this mess is. Retconning the original works is not going to work for Amazon.  They should just pull this nonsense and respect the works of Tolkien.  That is certainly too much to ask from  corporate conglomerates that steel and destroy everything.

Hereâ€™s to hoping it crashes and burns after the first season
They really be removing comments. 46879 comments as of writing this.
"As a fan of Tolkien's work, I can't wait to NOT watch this when it comes out.
They're just trying to ride the coat tails of this genre that was kicked off by Game of Thrones."
This has nothing to do with LOTR
"No matter how many PR save-face videos you publish, it won't work Amazon. ""Tolkien superfans"", ""Tolkien professors"", ""Tolkien super mega giga tera fans"", we know what you're trying to do. And it won't work. There are millions of us that know better. Sept 2 , 2022 will be an embarrassment."
can you feel the 1.6 million dislikes?
Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
This series is going to F L O P HARD Shame on you Amazon Shame
"Hey amazone, good job. You helped save me some more money by cancelling my prime membership. I hope you read this, I really appreciate it."
"What is this, a joke?"
115k likes vs 1.6M dislikes
Amazon has done an Amber Heard on Tolkien's bed!
"Deleting 2million of dislikes on YouTube will never make this series a hit, not even if the viewings are Hight, Iâ€™m gonna say that this can even make me retire my subscription from Amazon Prime, even if I bought the Tolkien movies, because I can also buy them on blue ray extended versions.... this just shows that the creators of this series ruined Star Wars, and ruined many more things than what they show."
"The author has created a deep and elaborated world, the history of which stretches for thousands of years. Elves, dwarves, hobbits and other races in the Lord of the Rings universe have their own origin stories and were created by a fictional god. Therefore, attempts to shift modern standards of inclusivity and racial equality to them do not correspond to what the author laid down in the original source.

In your opinion, in Anglosaxon story that was written by English writer and was based on the myths of the ANGLO-SAXON AND GERMANIC CULTURES herous must have black color of skin, especially elves.
BESIDES OF THIS,  elves have short hair and the princess of dwarves does not have beard....... you know that you are going against the original concept?"
115K likes - 1.6M dislikes (eyes)

Oh no...
Por el avance veo que serÃ¡ HORRIBLE ğŸ˜¤
"Okay I'm not saying the trailer is great either but y'all are going to have to come up with a complaint other than ""omg black people exist?!"""
"So this is the reason why YouTube closed the dislikes: to help corporate greed hiding its crap. Donâ€™t worry lol, no one will watch this sh*t, not even if paid. 1.600.000 dislikes and removing comments left and right â€” thatâ€™s the worst way to deal with your garbage."

It looks so animated and cheap.
this is dogshit. and I apologize to the dogs of the world.
1.6m dislikes xD Lol!
"This show is going to blow big balls. Why I hope this show crashes and burns just like The Kwan show, or Master cheeks."
We just need that one good person at Amazon to destroy this before release.

This is DoA
"I wanted to re-watch the trilogy and came across the trailer on prime video, and came here just to comment on how awful it looks. A high budget poorly produced fairytale."
Only 1.6 million downvotes? Here let me help you out.
Isnâ€™t even out yet and itâ€™s already screwed
Yupp this is  gonna suck. Good job of destroying the LOTR legacy!
Can't wait to play this game
"No matter how many comments and dislikes you delete, this is still trash Amazon. Learn to keep politics out of our beloved series!"
(115K unlike) vs (1.6M  i dislike this) Y OCULTADO AL OJO PUBLICO los valores reales que nadie le gusta esta adaptacion y abrumador numero de que le ira malisimo probablemente y termine siendo un fracaso y nadie lo vea ya que eso refleja la estadisticas bien claras de como se unde el bote
Nope get up to speed.
"What a strawman, every argument against this series is nothing like what you've just put out there. Try again"
Read the comments. People explain their complaints very clearly and it has nothing to do with race or gender
"OK, way to tell me you haven't read the comments without actually saying you haven't read the comments."
"If you're taking flak, you're hitting uncomfortably close to the target."
This is why I have a dislikes plug-in
"apagaram meu dislike, vim dar de novo"
Will someone explain to me where all the negativity in these comments is coming from?  I have not read the Simarillion  but love the LOTR books and movies.  This trailer doesn't get me as excited as I want it to but it seems like people in comments have very specific understanding of what is going on in this trailer.  What am I missing??  We barely get any dialogue or a real look at the plot of anything in this trailer.  How do you know it is going to be bad?
"Garbage, if you call this the adventures of tomy and timmy could be more cool, but you call it the lord of the rings, and you dont have nothing is very insulting, and why all  this sucks game of thrones ??"
I'm excited to see what they can do with this!
"""And he that breaks a thing to find out what it is, has left the path of wisdom,"" Gandalf, the Fellowship of the Ring"

omg 100k likes and 1.6 MILLION dislikes. surely thats some kind of record for a teaser or something?

This cannot be allowed to ever see the light of day
"Its more than the trailer, its articles on 'Tolkiens racism' , and paying influencers to like this"
"people are upset because the producers are infusing their leftist ideology into the story. It is  more important to them than accurately depicting Tolkien's created world, which was based on a geographically isolated Britain.  Imagine seeing Indians in Mulan, or Irish people in Wakanda. It spoils the integrity of the story. Galadriel is depicted as a warrior, which she never was. Her power was in magic.  There is also going to be sexually explicit scenes, which has absolutely no place in Tolkien. Romance was left to the imagination.

Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  have you seen it?
Â @alex juddÂ  the trailer? yes
Â @Mark MacMillanÂ you're judging it all on a trailer?
Â @alex juddÂ  nope

"so are you going to make your own twitter or are you happy with Musk?

Edit: Also ""if you want to have something made differently, make it yourself"", is not an argument in favour of an Adaptation of someone else's work."
"Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  Adaptations ARE pieces of work. Greek tragedies, Shakespeare, even biographies like Hamilton are adapted to fit the creators' vision."
"Â @John LockeÂ  You're ""defending"" a dead man but I am the one who needs help? Lol"
"Â @sunlioness1Â  Adaptations are pieces of work, thats not the issue. The issue is that Amazons RoP will not be of the original Creators vision. So why can't amazon make something original? Also yes we are defending a dead man, you say thay as if that's something weird to?"
easy to say until it happens to a piece of literature or art important to YOU.
"Â @Janelle OÂ  It's not happening ""to"" the work of art you love, you can continue enjoying it in its original form. But what gives you the right to prevent others from adapting it?"
Â @sunlioness1Â  good taste gives that right apart from anything else
Baby Shark got 15million dislikes. It's no where close to a record. ğŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸
"Â @Hendo CalrissianÂ  we don't know how many this rightfully has, because they keep deleting them."
"Â @Lil FishÂ  I know it was stuck at 160k dislikes for weeks then somehow shot up to over 3 million in rhe span of a couple of days without increasing the view count. Seems to me both sides are fudging the numbers. I'm going to give it a chance before judging it on a minute  long teaser.  It was in the news today. That what made me come back to check this chat.  They had a preview showing and people were saying it's awesome. Of course the hategrifter's arguement is predictable.  ""aMaZoN pAiD tHeM!"" I'll be checking it out on release."
Â @Hendo CalrissianÂ  you're keeping very close watch for someone who happens to be stopping by. You call all the fans grifters? If anything the true number according to average engagement of a video should be ten percent and the dislikes were extremely low given the amount of views. I think they were hiding the real number somehow but got caught... They are constantly deleting thousands of comments at a time. They made fake superfans...and they have done far worse. Truly no shame.
I can easily see it getting much worse as we get closer to the anniversary of Tolkien's death; which they saw fit to release this colossal dumpster fire of a production.
"Amazon is literally LARPing as Melkor right now. Actually, no. Now that I think about it Melkor would probably look at this and say to Amazon: ""Dude...this is taking the whole 'evil' thing too far..."""
"This sounds like the start of a Tolkien poem.  ""Where now the dislikes and comments?  Where are the Tolkien fans raging?"""
I'm getting really frustrated by the lack of respect for source material.
"Who care's about the most beloved historical and cultural art? It's not a religion! Let's repaint a Rembrant with emoji's for faces, and tear down the sculpture of David and make little cat figurines out of it's pieces! There's no value in masterpieces. Who careS?!"
I wonder how many dislikes this bs has
DISLIKE.
WHAT IS THIS ?!? IS THIS A JOKE ?? This must be a joke ....
"Well, I have read a lot of the work of tolkien and after watching this bs-trailer, im offended. I Think i will delete my primeaccount."

This show stinks
"I wish I could dislike this 1.5 million times, the same number of dislikes they deleted"

Serious question: can someone explain all the backlash this is getting?

I didnâ€™t know that lotr community is such a cringy community but now i do after reading these negative comments
why
I smell a dumpster fire smoldering in the near future.
HOORRIBLE adaptation of a classic. Stop taking a timeless classic and altering it to fit 2022 changes. Changes that will change again in a few years
Hey Amazon if youâ€™re reading this this is what Iâ€™ve got to say to you the Tolkien. World has had fans will always have fans it is a guaranteed successful market for somebody who wants to dive in.... all you have to do is follow the writing written by the man himself take your time do a good job and boom youâ€™ve got a smashing hit.... what are their 50 million of us who spent summers growing up reading these books watching these movies and daydreaming about this wonderful place....Itâ€™s like cheeseburgers youâ€™ve got the best selling cheeseburger on the planet youâ€™ve got 500 million People that love your cheeseburger some new guy comes along buys the company and he changes everything on that cheeseburger because heâ€™s trying to draw in a new crowd of 2 million people who actually only like chicken nuggets....Do you understand what Iâ€™m saying
Awesome! I can't wait
If you aren't going to give the story the respect it deserve than just drop it an make your own intellectual property. Maybe you should have asked Peter Jackson some questions. Im tired of these unoriginal turds ruining great stories because they are too lazy to come up with their own.
Not to mention lack of respect for the fans.
there is an add on extension for that...although the real number was once higher..........
Â @Laura NaphtaliÂ  ahh so what's the number now?
"Â @HasanÂ  1.6 million, but once it was up to 3.1 million, then reduced to 1.3 million, which then magically disappeared along with thousands of comments."
Â @Luciano FernandezÂ  Thanks! They're trying so hard to conceal their failure. funny
"Â @HasanÂ  truth is, I haven't downloaded it, but the word is 1.6 million"
i already did. make sure you tell them why
"because they are making up their own story in Tolkien's name that disregards his real story for this time period, and messing up central characters... and because they want all of middle earth, past, present, and future.  And because they lie about the fans and They disrespect Tolkien. They also went back on their word about what they said they would do.
They release this the day Tolkien D13D. That is no accident."
thats Tolkist
Cry me a river.
Any fanbase of a franchise this old hates it when people rewrite good characters and stories.
Â @Jamie WoodsÂ  yeah i donâ€™t understand them this trailer looks really promising of a good tv show
Â @Awab AbdÂ  lol no it doesn't.
"Â @Awab AbdÂ  Sure it does, as long as you don't want a show set in middle Earth... Or decent story telling in general."
your $$$$$
Can we really even call it an adaptation if they are completely changing the story and slapping Tolkien's name on it?
"Â @Laura NaphtaliÂ  Random scary thought - I wonder if the ""forbidden love"" between Arondir and Bronwyn is just going to be a role-reversed ""Beren and Luthien"" thing."

1.6 million downvotes
"Never! More garbage, and this time you've messed with Tolkien. Very bad idea. You have pissed of millions."
"Seriously, did no one come forward and say ""hey guys, maybe we shouldn't do this""....I'm just amazed at the lack of self awareness. Amazon, your messing with the wrong fan group."
115k likes vs 1.6M dislikes
Haha I'm not sure I've ever seen anything so cringe. Can't wait to find out why and how Tolkien was a racist and how Amazon liberal-splained and fixed it.
"If your treachery wasn't enough Amazon, you are now openly giving out gifts to people. That is what Annatar (the Giver of Gifts) aka Sauron did, you dumb minions of the Shador."
looks crap to be fair
Dislike x1
This doesn't feel right
This makes the hobbit triology look like a masterpiece. They have to keep killing our childhood
Actually rancid
Just cancel prime like I did with D+.
"Let's see, over 29,711,000 views and barely over 115,000 likes? According to YouTube I should just assume it has 29 million dislikes."
This is pathetic really
"because they are making up their own story in Tolkien's name that disregards his real story for this time period, and messing up central characters... and because they want all of middle earth, past, present, and future.  And because they lie about the fans and They disrespect Tolkien. They also went back on their word about what they said they would do."
"The trailer shows nothing and looks generic fantasy, could you tell it is in any way related to the Silmarillion without the title?"
Why do you think they fired their actual Tolkien scholar?
1.6 million for now

Iâ€™m not watching this until few white peoples are replaced with black.
"I maybe alone on this but for a fantasy it looks visually boring, but that's a problem with all live action fantasy. I don't feel like there is enough it from your standard medieval movie, just with more makeup & a little CGI."
"Oh no, they just had to didnâ€™t they. Yet another franchise to be killed"
NÃ£o vejo a hora da estrÃ©ia.
I literally just watched LOTR trilogy with my girlfriend and this has ruined my week. LOTR is written as a fantasied ancient Europe. Why are characters who I presume are main characters from a different cultural diversity as to the ones in tolkiens books. People from the west and north in LOTR are always white whilst people from the south and east have different skin tone. So why is there a black elf who in the books are always white?
They shown a lot of stuff without showing anything at all.

These comments make me proud to be a LOTR fan. The orc armies of Ama Zon will break on Tolkien's masterpiece like water upon rock.
"This is absolute gargage, even for Amazon. 1.6M dislikes and counting."
TRASH
Thank you!!
Rules this series out then
"Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  Nah, I judge after watching the series, not pre-judging a teaser"
"Â @Rune BrÃ¥ten LundbergÂ  but if it looks good, and therefore you will watch it, is that not pre-judging? because you have determined its worth from the trailer have you not?"
"Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  I never said it was good before Ive watched it. I said the trailer looks good, and that means Im gonna give it a watch before I judge if I like it or not. So no, its no pre-judging, like most of the comments here."
Â @Rune BrÃ¥ten LundbergÂ  There is more than enough information to pre judge it
"Â @Rune BrÃ¥ten LundbergÂ  No you said ""if it's good I'll watch it"" in the context of something you don't care for the lore of, just that its sci fi / adventure"" you made no mention of the trailer.

You may have implied you only will watch the show if the trailer looks good. But juding the teaser trailer is an inherant pre-judgement of the show, there are no two ways around that. Because, logically you are saying ""the trailer looks good, therefore the show must be worth watching"" which is a pre-judgement.

To that, your position boils down to ""I don't care about long standing and carefully woven narratives, i just like the shiny shiny"" which is a position on tv that my 3 year old would take."
"If you like the last season of Game of Thrones, you will like this. If you like only the early ones, you will not like this... I've seen some of the leaked auditions with actual writing from the script and it was cringeworthy."

Why would you want to f***k up a body of work just to make it reflect today's world ?"
"Welcome to a new era of political correctness where you are manipulated just the way they want you to. Even if it is worth destroying such a masterpiece like the Tolkien's book. Why can't they just follow what it is the book and not their interpretation? 
The way it goes, it won't be a surprise Donald Trump will be the new Sauron according to their interpretation and Lady Gaga the poor princess assaulted by the system. Everything is just about politics nowadays. 
Another dislike for the records!"
"So disappointed, how can you have so much money and still can't get it right. First wheel of time one of my favourite books was ruined now another of my beloved has to be turned to trash by unimaginative bofoons with a diversity agenda, as a person mixed African and European, I am disgusted with these diversity warriors."

A historian teacher wrote lord of the rings based in our European myths. Just wanna say that.
"1.6 milion dislikes, oh boy."
"They don't care about minorities or diversity, they want money."
Everyone read the Silmarillion so you can understand how much they're butchering. It's more than just the trilogy.
Why actually adapt the last part of the Silmarillion when you can throw in a bunch of OC's and butcher Galadriels behavior. Way to turn a noble ruling mage into a knight.
They literally lost me at four seconds. When her pseudo-English accent becomes American.. mid-sentence. Looks absolutely awful.
"Or you can go back and watch the absolutely terrible Fellowship of the Ring trailer. I'll reserve judgment until the actual show comes out, but it doesn't seem promising."
What the hell are you on about? We know nothing about the plot
Â @Runes of RudeÂ  actually the creators agve released a lot more than this trailer as far as Information.
"Â @Runes of RudeÂ  lol, what? we already know the plot."
"And? I miss the part where it has any difference with ""za message"" being shoved down our throats."
"It's still very much his story and lifework. If someone wants to create their own fantasy, do it, but you are supposed to handle someone else's lifework and their masterpiece with respect."

Your big complaint is that it's not like LOTR, do we really want another ridiculously long journey with some wars happening on the side.

"I noticed a lot of LOTR fans are disappointed of this show including me. 
I guess HOTD worths the wait"
Who's gonna lose is amazon...about a billion dollars so far to be exact. ğŸ˜Œ
"these producers/directors/studios are so tone deaf. if you wanna make money on an established product -- it takes zero creativity, just copy the lore everyone wants to see instead making up bs. This looks way worse than what they did to Halo or Picard."
Â @nundziÂ  this is definitely way beyond compared to what Netflix did to The Witcher.
"And another one with the excuse of ""wait to see it to judge it""
When people say its not lotr they mean its not middle earth, you are not going to see what else is happening"
"Â @AE3587Â  what do you mean it's not middle-earth? It's about the other rings, I don't get how that's not middle-earth And all I'm saying is you don't see much in the trailer so it's a bit weird to judge the entire show on that."
I'm not interested in an Amazon original with no lore.
"Â @Aamon ZantvoortÂ  The only thing middle earth about this is the title
The trailer is not the inly informatio"
"Why all of a sudden, amazon shills start shitting on pj lotr movies?"
"Â @HÃºrin ThalionÂ  Amazon had a big ""super fan"" get together for youtubers, and they all came back with this script."
"Â @HÃºrin ThalionÂ  don't get me wrong I love Lotr, the Hobbit was alright, but I would like something a bit different to them, they are both very similar to eachother and I think it would be mad to change it up a little bit, just see wars and lore rather than a really long adventure across the land. I also want to know more about how we got the rings and whatnot. And isn't this at least party influenced by the Silmarillion?"
"Â @Aamon ZantvoortÂ  well, if you want to learn more about middle earth why dont you read silmarillion then. Also amazon doesnt have rights on the silmarillion, which means that they are not going to adapt the events of the second age from the akallabeth or the unfinished tales, but rather try and make their own stuff."
"You found the LOTR Boring: a ""redilculously long journey with some wars on the side."" The movies were riveting and deep. What you say only emphasizes how much this is not for those who love LOTR. Got it. We agree."
"Â @Lil FishÂ  what are you on about, I love Lotr, I'm just saying that based on the fact that the journey is a year and there a wars around Frodo's journey. And it's cool but it get over played especially when the Hobbit is very similar with a long journey that ends in a war, Lotr was amazing cus it was one of a kind but in saying that I don't want everything in Middle-Earth to revolve around one person travels while everyone is fighting for or against them around them."
"Â @Aamon ZantvoortÂ  lol 1. What are you on?if the way you describe the movies is a tediously long journey and some battles, you missed what made it great. PERIOD. Hide your disdain more if you want to pretend to like it. 2. why would the whole history be like the journeyof one character when Tolkien didn't write it that way. That doesn't make sense."
"Â @Lil FishÂ  yeah I never said it was bad but your crazy if you don't think three three hour movies isn't long. Look we aren't really disagreeing here. I'm just saying I'm glad it's different, the Silmarillion isn't about one person's year long journey across middle-earth, they should've got those rights so we can see Morgoth since a lot of people don't even know he existed in middle-earth. I'm just glad Amazon isn't making Lotr again, have a new character do the exact same thing as what we saw in Lotr"
"Â @Lil FishÂ  Look if trying to convince me that I don't like one of my favourite movie series helps you sleep at night then you do you, but your not going to convince me, I recently found out what gas lighting is and I'm pretty sure that's what your doing, Tryna get me to believe that I meant something different than I actually meant."
"Â @Aamon ZantvoortÂ  I'm not trying to gaslight you. There are simply a lot of shills that come here and rag on the films, or pretend to be fans and say somehow Amazon's show will be better.  If you like the films, great... The way you described the story is simply a way I have never  viewed it, nor would I characterize it in such a boring and unflattering light. the time flies for me when I watch it."
"Â @Aamon ZantvoortÂ  yeah, this show won't be the simirillian... They can't Introduce the main characters or plots, and originally told C. Tolkien this would be about the young Aragon's life. As soon as he passed away they did a 180 for rid of the xprts and ramped up production. They knew he was old and we're just biding their time. 
They have 0 respect for the characters of galadriel and elrond. They have utter disregard for the story and characters. . . So it's not Tolkien. They should just take his name off of it. Also, they want to re shoot the movies . .   They are in talks to buy the authority to do just that."
"Â @Lil FishÂ  well it sounds like your trying to gaslight me, I'm saying I enjoy them but I don't want a tv show that's exactly the same and your saying that's cus I don't like LOTR, it doesn't matter how it feels, it's an epic movie, most epic movies are 3 hours compared to the standard movie run time of approximately 2 hours, i.e. Longer. They are great movies, they didn't do as well with the Hobbit so I don't want them to make something the same, it worked once, didn't work a second time."
"Â @Aamon ZantvoortÂ If you want to sound like you like it idk maybe talk about things you actually liked in it. Describing it in an only negative light as a tediously long journey with a few fights on the side makes it sound a monotonous, dull experience. It's my favorite movie of all time, and I would never describe it in such a boring and unflattering way...and saying it's super long to watch also makes you sound bored. It's not gaslighting to call out something that comes across as super sus."
"Â @Lil FishÂ  Â @Lil FishÂ  no it's gaslighting to take one small part of my original comment and twist that to your needs and continuously tell me what I mean when you obviously don't understand what I mean, your looking at the wrong part and focussing on that, I said it was a long movie with some wars on the side, I love it and it's great but I also love fantasy movies that focus on the war and have the main character fighting in them."
"Â @Aamon ZantvoortÂ   I'm not trying to convince you of anything: I already conceded when you said you really did like it, okay, so maybe you do but that does not change the fact that it comes across suspicious and  to characterize something you like in ONLY negative terms.

you can't use gaslighting as a way to discount other people's right to perceptions. Honestly to say it is gaslighting to share a valid perception based on the information given, is more gaslighty than anything."
"Â @Lil FishÂ  yeah whatever your still focussing on a small detail in my overall comment and basically attacking me over an opinion you think that I have. Like even if I didn't like it I have every right to say so without you going off at me for disliking it. As I said before it worked once, didn't work a second time so I'm glad they aren't trying a third time, that's all I was saying but your blowing it way out of proportion and trying to convince me of something that isn't true at all, therefore gaslighting. Say it sounds like that then leave it, you just don't stop."
Â @Aamon ZantvoortÂ  That was a central point in your comment.  I'm not trying to convince you of anything. Get off of your high horse and stop playing victim.
"Stop editing your comments after you post them and I'm not you have just been going on about me apparently hating on the best fantasy movies, so idk what your problem is but I'm done with this, it's wasting my time and I have better things to do. Have a fun life in your little make believe world. I tried agreeing with you but apparently all you want is conflict. See ya."
"Â @Aamon ZantvoortÂ  dude. No. Wrong and untrue. The first time I made an assertion that you didn't like it. After that I said okay, maybe you do like it, since you say so, it's just weird how you described it. At that point i took back my statement. And then you couldn't let it go Then you went on about gaslighting and I defended the fact that even if you do like it, it's still weird,and suspicious from my perception..and I don't owe you a change in MY perception. so stop saying I'm doing something that I'm not, and that I don't have a right to question.  your behavior is questionable from an outside perspective and it's not gaslighting to say so."

You....Shall....Not.... PASS!!!!!!!
I think this is garbage ... although maybe Amazon could send me on a free bus tour around London and Oxford and prime me with booze. Then I can like it while wearing my free Rings of Power jacket and 'welcome bag'. Will cancel prime the day this crap hits the TV. Hopefully the other 1.6 million who disliked it will do the same. WHole thing reminds me of the shaper of Bezos's rocket :P
"I came back again to look at the dislike, it's almost as much as the subscribers welp."
"was a mistake not to have Cate Blanchett voice there.
Even though I suspect this Tv show adaption going to be superb 
People love old rehearsed stuff to much."
"In general, this teaser gives us nothing about the things this series is supposed to be about: The Rings of Power. We have no scene featuring Sauron in the guise of Annatar, nor is there anything about Numenor. These are the two storylines which dominate the second age of Middle Earth but theyâ€™re completely absent. And this music is very generic.

*Specific frames or points of the teaser trailer.* 

This looks a lot like the Grey Havens from Return of the King. Problem is that those werenâ€™t established until the beginning of the third age when the elves really began leaving Middle Earth for Valinor en masse.

I donâ€™t know who these moose men are supposed to be. That has no correlation or precedence with the cultures of Men anywhere in the books.

Hobbits should not be on screen. No one takes notice of them until the very end of the third age, nor do they play any role in the events of the second age.

â€œBefore the Kingâ€. This is inaccurate. Theyâ€™re clearly trying to say before Aragorn, but there were kings in this time. Gil-Galad is the reigning King of the Noldorian Elves and High King of all elves in Middle Earth, which is a position he retains until the very end of the second age at the closing of the seven year Siege of Barad-Dur where he died without an heir. Second are the entire line of Kings of Numenor, the great island kingdom of the Edain. They are ruling as well. In fact, this is the line from which the kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor are born, ruled by a line of kings which stretch without break all the way from Elros Tar-Minyatur to Aragorn Elessar. Thatâ€™s not even getting into the numerous dwarf kingdoms, all with their own ruling family. A more accurate statement would have been â€œIn the time of Kingsâ€.

This is supposed to be Galadriel but Iâ€™m not sure what sheâ€™s doing here. My best guess is that this is her when she was crossing the Helecrax during the first age, which would make this a flashback image. Chronologically, she should be either with her husband Celeborn in the east or in Lindon with the court of Gil-Galad depending on when exactly this show is supposed to be taking place. At no point was she crossing the Grinding Ice or any ice for that matter.

â€œBefore the Fellowship.â€ No issue. Thatâ€™s accurate.

I donâ€™t know who this guy at sea is or why heâ€™s with Galadriel. None of this happens in the source material.

Iâ€™m sorry to break this bluntly, but Elves arenâ€™t black. At most they have olive or paler skin. Thatâ€™s just how it is. Tolkien described them, and he was very specific with his descriptions. This is further compounded by the geographical and genetic nature of the elves. They are essentially immortal and were one large monogamous species which split into subgroups based on cultural differences. Hundreds of thousands of years could pass and the generations will have barely changed from a purely physical standpoint. By the third age the biggest difference we have is that they have diverse hair colors, which becomes the primary way for men to tell them apart. Basically, if you put an elf from each group all in the same clothing, you wouldnâ€™t be able to tell them apart from each other aside from their hair color. They donâ€™t change like the race of Men, which is very diverse and subdivided far quicker compared to them. Iâ€™m going to assume this is supposed to be either a Silvan elf or a Sindarin elf, because those were the tribes closely associated with the woods. If I were to nitpick, he really gives off cosplayer vibes, not a professionally made or filmed elf in Middle Earth. He also doesnâ€™t have the flowing hair of Tolkienâ€™s elves, but a modern buzz cut.

â€œBefore the Ringâ€. This is a weird thing to say. The One Ring is forged in this era along with the 19 lesser rings.

Iâ€™m going to come back to this image of the comet, because hoo boy do I have some points.

No clue who this is. My best guess is either Gil-Galad or Celebrimbor. Not sure why heâ€™s surrounded by coins scattered on the ground.

Galadriel was not at war in the second age. As I already said, she should be in Lindon in the court of Gil-Galad or East with her husband Celeborn. Weird that we also havenâ€™t seen anything of him.

What the hell is that thing? Nothing in Tolkienâ€™s catalogue resembles this skull crawler. And is this Galadriel underground? Where is she? Moria?

â€œA new legendâ€. Uh, no. Itâ€™s a new legend alright, because this isnâ€™t Tolkienâ€™s work.

This bearded guy is Durin 4, prince of Moria. Keep that in mind.

This is supposed to be Elrond. Iâ€™m not sure where he is, but he should likewise be in Lindon as an advisor and lore master of Gil-Galadâ€™s court, not in the middle of some battle.

Now, this woman is supposed to be a new dwarf character created for the show. Her look is completely wrong. She should have a beard. Tolkien was very specific with his descriptions of the dwarves, and the men and women look identical to the point that no one outside of other dwarves can tell the genders apart. Also, nitpicking, but her attire and hair has a very African/Nubia Egyptian look. That clashes with the look of the kingdom of Moria, where she is supposed to be princess. This wouldnâ€™t be an issue if she was a member of one of the other 6 Dwarven Houses, but sheâ€™s specifically stated to be a member of the house of Durin. And just to reiterate, sheâ€™s supposed to be the sister of Durin 4. Unless there is some adoption stuff going on, I donâ€™t see how they can be siblings. And no, Dwarves never cheat. They choose one partner for the rest of their lives, and will stay single out of spite if they canâ€™t have the one they want.

Again, what is Galadriel doing on this raft? And why is she letting someone check her ears? What is going on?

And here we have Gandalf. No, I am not bullshitting, that comet was Gandalf coming to Middle Earth, and this is him getting helped out of the inferno by a hobbit. First, the Istari, or Wizards, donâ€™t arrive in Middle Earth from Valinor in the second age. They only enter the scene halfway into the third one. Second, where are the other four Wizards? They came in a specific order, and Gandalf was last to arrive. Third, this is not the manner in which they arrived to Middle Earth. The Istari came to Middle Earth from across the sea in boats as old men robes in colored cloaks and armed with nothing but a staff, and they came to the Grey Havens where they were met by Cirdan the Shipwright. This is even how Gandalf acquires his own lesser ring of power, it was given to him by its keeper, Cirdan. But that story is clearly going to have to be changed now.

More battle snippets, but I have no context for any of this. Sauron doesnâ€™t make any military moves until after the Rings of Power are forged, and he makes his first war on the elves. (Yes, first. There were multiple wars Sauron waged throughout the later two thirds of the second age.) I donâ€™t know why an elf is in chains because thereâ€™s no one strong enough to enslave the elves while Gil-Galad is around, and I donâ€™t know who theyâ€™re supposed to be fighting. None of this is making sense from the timeline.

Gandalf and hobbits should not be a thing in this show."

Gayest comment right here
Galadriel was powerful because she had a powerfull mind and spirit and not because she had muscles of a bodybuilder or sword and armor. She wielded magic powerfull enough to banish Sauron himself. That is quite achievement unavaliable for any other living creature of Middle Earth. She was probably the most powerfull non-deity being on Arda. That was her true strengh and her gentle heart only added to that. In other word she is the ultimate archetype of how a strong woman should be.
There's an extension for that

At one point there was over 1.8 million dislikes versus a pathetic 110k likes (over half paid fr) for this crap show.  Amazon can't accept the screw up they have made with wheel of time series either. They just ignore what fans want and produce garbage and think if they throw enough money at it somehow it will do good (just like their New World video game failure).

Why do I get the feeling that they actually took everything wrong with the Hobbit and said now let's make a series out of this.

It looks anything but solid to people who have read the books. It is obvious they are not representing Tolkien's work or vision.  Hope it's worth your time.

terrible.

How can yâ€™all tell how much you dislike this show from this measly trailer? Wtf
1.6 Million dislikes Amazon. You cant hide them all. You should publicly apologize for what you have done to Tolkien's AND Robert Jordan's work. I unsubscribed my Prime because of what you did to The Wheel of Time. I hope all the LotR fans do the same.
"Game of Thrones prequel House Of The Dragon trailer already seen,
Lord of The Ring:The Ring of Power teaser also seen. We are waiting for the blast."
"In all legends and tales, elves are creatures with clean, unblemished white skin, long pointed ears and long hair, the color of which depends on where they live.

 Dwarves, on the contrary, are creatures with a height of more than one meter, always walking in armor, and behind their backs they have an ax or a mace.  Dwarfs are skilled blacksmiths and guardians of their lands, ready to stand up for their lands to the end, no matter who their enemy is.  As Gimli said, ""among the dwarves everyone wears a beard, both women and men, so no one has ever seen dwarf girls"""

I could still read it though and ok I see why people are upset with that. For me I donâ€™t care about elven skin colour or beardless dwarves as long as the story is good. But I do agree itâ€™s pretty arrogant and ridiculous to say they want to make something better than Tolkien did while using his work as the basis for it. I saw the super fans stuff, pretty obvious pandering."
"Â @Ziggy WaltersÂ  there is a lot of concern over things the showrunners, producers and ""Alleged"" Tolkien Schoolers have said they were doing with the show. This trailer does not do anything to relieve those concerns, in fact it re-enforces them. the only thing ""Tolkien"" about this show looks to be his name.  I will take a hard pass on this one."
Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  yea after doing some more reading I see that.

"Would somebody please explain to me why people are upset? Forgive me, Iâ€™m not taking Amazonâ€™s side or anything, Iâ€™m just generally curious to understand the backlash. I didnâ€™t actually know a new Lotr show was coming until now, so apologies for that, just trying to figure out where people stand here and wrap my head around whatâ€™s going on."
I'm guessing you couldn't get the rights to any actual stories from Tolkiens work so now you're making up your own without fully understanding the world or its characters?
Hope this bankrupts Amazon. The destruction of LOTR should not go unpunished!
"â€œThere is no curse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of Men for this treachery.â€ â€• J.R.R. Tolkien"
This is looking really bad
Even if you remove the strong presence of â€œthe messageâ€ it still doesnâ€™t feel like Tolkien. This isnâ€™t middle earth.
The audacity that these clowns can compete with Tolkien is laughable. This is a fail and a complete insult to the fandom.
use my comment as a diselike botton
As with everything these days being successful is more about what's seen as good marketing than actually making a good product. This is worse than the hobbit for making everything VFX and it's story is purely based on appealing to a diverse audience. Get ready for the worst show you'll probably ever watch
Did they seriously delete negative comments? ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚
Prepare to be dissapointed
Thy don't intend to tie it together with the other films. They want to purchase the film rights and make their own films. They are working on it
They are destroying the story and main characters. They aren't following what Tolkien wrote and deserting his work. They also want more film rights.

"LOTR fans, this is going to be another repeat of what happened to Star Wars, so please do not watch this show, not even the first episode. We fans can't let Amazon get away with trying to destroy an entire culture as Disney did with Star Wars. While us Star Wars fans tried to make Disney pay for what they did with criticism, Disney just ate up the criticism like it was nothing, and so they took off with our hearts and money, and couldn't care less about the fact they just ruined the Star Wars movie franchise. Amazon has seen Disney's ""financial success"" with Star Wars and is prepared to repeat what they did, but we fans should know better now. So we cant let another travesty happen so openly. We have to resist the temptation to watch even one episode, and just listen to a YT review if we really want to know if it's good or not.

My favorite franchise, Star Wars is changed forever and my second favorite LOTR is approaching doom, so I'm sorta willing to do whatever to stop this."

"Â @AE3587Â  Yes they are. Netflix's Witcher ticks most of these boxes and it is one of the best fantasy shows ever created. A fantasy world with racial diversity is amazing if you think it's not I think you have a problem with diversity. Just enjoy the show for what it is (a trendy modern twist on an old and racist franchise) and stop complaining.

I watched a few clips from the old LoTR movies. They look awful. All white cast. Bad costumes instead of CGI (how???) and all this other bad stuff. Worst part of all is I saw barely any women, no black people, no LGBTQ+ representation and the movies seem to be dominated by white men. This series will put everything right with this franchise.

â€‹Â @Tuomas HuuhtanenÂ  The only thing I find fun is how many haters are coming at me when I stated my mind. Barely anyone I know has watched LoTR. But interestingly enough all my friends want to watch this show! This show will do just fine and I think it's a good thing they are changing it up. A non diverse cast for a show or movie does nothing but hurt our society.
Â @L NAPHÂ  You don't know that. This show looks insanely promising. It might even give the mandalorian a run for its money.

Source?
Â @jj48Â  Just look up Tom Shippey. Btw this is my 3rd reply so not sure if these are going through or not...
"Â @Alexander MalinÂ  I am well familiar with Tom Shippey.  I also know of his involvement with the show and his dismissal.  However, I have been able to find no information on his dismissal being in any way linked to him ""calling out"" Amazon for ""twisting this fantasy universe"".  That bit is nothing more than a fan rumor with no real source."
"Â @jj48Â  Ah so if you're trying to defend Amazon, and call yourself a fan of Tolkien, then you should look up Cory Olsen's recent video for Rings of Power where he stumbles over lore like ""Its not really confirmed in the works that dwarven women have beards"" while trying to defend Amazon. Feel free to join him on this hill."
"Â @Alexander MalinÂ   Do you mean the IGN video where they significantly edited down about three hours of interview into a few clips without greater context?  It was definitely not his best work, but much of the criticism was blown out of proportion (and some of it flat-out wrong).

Personally, I prefer Professor Olsen's actual, full classes and discussions.  Particularly, ""Exploring the Lord of the Rings"" and his Mythgard Academy classes for literature, or his show/adaptation discussions in ""Riddles in the Dark"" (the Hobbit films) and ""Other Minds and Hands"" (Amazon's Rings of Power)."
"Â @jj48Â  I'm not trying to attack the Tolkien lovers, I am merely saying that Amazon hasn't paid them the same respect you and I clearly do. Regardless of context, the IGN video was still seen by the public as a way to start excusing certain discrepancies that the Rings of Power showrunners are inserting. Look, its clear we both like the source material and would love nothing more than an exciting show for us to get happy about. I want to be proven wrong by Amazon, but if the fears of the fandom come to pass we cannot allow it to go unnoticed."
"Â @Alexander MalinÂ   I guess we're getting a little far from my initial point, which was simply that we have no credible source for the idea that Tom Shippey's dismissal was over lore disagreements.  If people have concerns over the show that they want to discuss (or not discuss, even), that's fine and understandable.  But I'm also seeing a lot of rumors that are at best unsubstantiated, and at worst flat-out false, which people are using to justify their dislike.  People are entitled to their opinions, but I just urge people to base those opinions on what we know rather than wild speculation."
"This show is not an adaptation of The Silmarillion, because Amazon doesn't have the rights to it. The show is based on the appendices of the Lord of the Rings."
Â @ReekÂ   that's obvious.
1.6 million dislikes lmao
"ah yes because that mantra has never backfired. People certainly didn't decide to not buy battlefield 5 and sutherland definitely didn't lose his position for saying ""don't like it don't buy it"""

"It's Tolkien's work, not Jackson's. And you haven't seen it."
Â @ReekÂ  I have read whole Tolkiens books. And all films of Jacksons adaptation of Tolkiens work. The teaser shows nothing common with this work.
"Â @Hans MatyskaÂ  It's great that you have read the books. I think the teaser doesn't say much (it tries to be epic, which it shouldn't be)."
Have you seen it?
Â @ReekÂ  You dont need to see it
"It's funny that so many people are judging a show which hasn't even aired yet. Most of the people here probably haven't even read the books, but only watched Jacksons movies."
What part of this trailer suggest that it doesn't?
Â @DbadaingÂ  I don't pay money for people to preach their political ideals & agenda @ me.
Â @Baron FamilyÂ  what political ideals or agenda is being pushed here?
lol even the CGI is worse than game of thrones. hahaha these people are high or something
"this is honestly a tragedy, it's almost worse then book burning it's perverting the text. I can't wait to see the backlash . the fucked up part is they are probably gonna still turn a shallow profit regardless of bad reviews."

I much prefer history â€“ true or feignedâ€“ with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.

This trailer killed all excitement I had for this series. I'll be waiting to see audience reviews on it before I sub to Amazon in order to watch it. Originally I planned on signing up for Amazon Prime just to watch this show the day it came out. I will be waiting to do so now. So far Amazon appears to have done a very poor job on this series."

Tolkien hated allegory and he most certainly would not have liked his work being crassly used to make comments on the world today. Also where the hell is Galdadrial's husband Celeborn and what the sweet F is she doing in armor (early 16c by the look of it) since she's one of the most powerful beings on middle earth.... Come on Amazon if you're going to adapt Tolkien then stick to the source material and not some agenda-driven writer's social commentary wank fantasy! Nil point!

"Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  The show looks awful, but would you mind providing specific examples in which they are ""destroying Tolkien's intentions""- it doesn't come out for months, so methinks it's because of certain casting choices :)"
"Â @Carson WallÂ  Did i use the phrase ""destroying Tolkiens intentions""? I don't think I did. I said they are undoing his lifelong works. I'll give one example out of goodwill and that is the addition of wizards and hobbits in the 2nd age, despite them not being in middle earth at that time. that is a flagrant disregard for the lore. There are more but consindering you are so hard pressed to assume I and others are racist, I am pretty sure you do not care for examples unless they fit your pre determined narrative."
"Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  The series is not canon, so none of Tolkiens work is being undone."
Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  Do you have sources confirming that the lore will be flagrantly disregarded?
Â @ReekÂ  Did you read the example in my previous comment?
"Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  yes. But do you have sources confirming the presence of Hobbits and Wizards in the Amazon series?
About Hobbits. As far as I know, Hobbits existed in the Second Age, but they played no role in the major events of the Second Age. I have heard that Amazon wanted to use some ancestors of Hobbits, but I'm not sure.
About Wizards. The Istari arrived in the Third Age. If the series uses one or more of the Istari, then it's a major (negative) change from the books."

UNDERRATED COMMENT ğŸ¯
Old franchises tend to have very loyal fanbases that don't like outside sources tampering with or rewriting lore
Â @Mitch LÂ  Especially when you see beardless dwarf women and black elves.
They are butchering Tolkien's story and main characters.
Â @Mitch LÂ  oh i understand... thanks!
"Â @Mitch LÂ  Yes, LotR has a large loyal fanbase. But I have the impression that many of the people complaining here are not really LotR fans. They're complaining because they want to complain."
"Â @ReekÂ  I get where you're coming from, but I think that's an easy way to dismiss fans actual concerns about this show. 

I'll be honest I'm not feeling too hopeful about this show either. They are rewriting characters, rewriting lore and inserting their own things into Tolkiens world. One of my favourite franchises (he-man) got rewritten in a similar way. I completely understand why so many of these fans are upset. We're talking about an authors work that he put blood sweat and tears into, that millions of people fell in love with. People really do adore the world and story Tolkien created and now some random corporation is twisting that world into something else. I think negative reactions are understandable."
"Â @Mitch LÂ  There are plenty of actual concerns from real Tolkien fans. But many of the comments here are laughable or pathetic (mostly both). They use quotes from Tolkien (which are often false) or complain about ''the message'' or diversity.

I have my worries aboot this show. But I have not seen it, so I can't judge now. And it is not canon; the books are canon and they will not be changed by this. At the worst case this is going to be a bad show using the LotR brand."

"Â @Larry GraysmithÂ  In Star Wars the movies are canon, so bad movies (most of them) undermine the franchise. Rings of Power is not canon, so even if it is terrible, it won't do any damage to the books."

Everything from the Rankin and Bass Hobbit, to Ralph Baksheesh's Lord of the Rings, to even The Hobbit by Peter Jackson.

This one... not so much. The more I see stills of the trailer, the more I wonder how much they ripped from Game of Thrones or, as other people have said, ""generic fantasy"". Disappointment all around."

"There's a difference between an interpretation or adaptation versus producing your own stories and slapping someone's famous name on them.  Leonard Berstein's ""West side story"" is an interpretation of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet.""  Peter Jackson's LoTR trilogy is an adaptation of Tolkien's books to cinema (IMO about as decent an adaptation as anyone could reasonably expect).  This is just Amazon doing its own thing, and selling it under Tolkien's name."
What?
Thatâ€™s deep. Are you 12 years old?
Â @WserthmarÂ  he is right
"Faramir takes Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath; Frodo sends Sam away; Aragorn fake dies in an unnecessarily added warg attack; Lorien Elves at Helms Deep; The Army of Dead at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields; Aragorn beheads an emissary during negotiations.

Yes, Peter Jackson really honored the books."
The writers are misrepresenting Tolkien's world
"They are rewriting middle earth lore and these barely experienced showrunners believe they can do better than Tolkien hismself who spent his entire life inventing this world. So far what we know of this abomination is that it stands to defy the morals, purpose and existing characters that Tolkien wrote into his world."
"Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  The show is not canon, so no lore is rewritten."
"Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  Yes, that is true"
Â @Janelle OÂ  Like Peter Jackson did?
"Â @ReekÂ  Whilst I agree it is not canon, they are still creating this series on the back of Tolkiens work and using it as a vehicle for the MESSAGE"
Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  what message?
"Galadriel is a videogame character in The Battle of Five Armies and I enjoyed that, so I'm fine with a warrior princes."
"To me this trailer feels like Narnia. It is possible that the show will be a generic fantasy (good or bad) using the Lord of the Rings brand. But the show has not aired yet: it is way too soon to judge whether the show will be good or bad, or how true it stays to the books."
Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  oh gawd.

Why do the characters look like people off the street of LA ? Like didn't even get a chance to visit the makeup booth ....
"Context: I haven't read the Silmarillion, I have seen all the LotR and the Hobbit movies, I have played Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War, two games that motivated me to learn about Eregion, Celebrimbor, Anatar and the creation of the rings of power, I can describe to someone Sauron's plan, yes I call him Saruman, not Saurman, I can tell some differences between a Valar and  a Maiar. Though I am not deep in the LotR fandom, my toes are wet for sure. 

I just found out about this trailer and I have to say... it didn't show that much to like... or dislike. it was acceptably bland, to my taste. Yet I see so many people disliking this acceptably bland trailer.

Could someone pls explain to me: What is so offensive? What is so disrespectful? Why there are so many people disliking it?

For real, I'm not here to criticise anyone's opinion, I am genuinely asking for an explanation because I,m just not deep enough in the fandom."

"So, another talent free bunch of PC idiots is rewriting my favorite book. Jeez, I thought Peter Jackson screwed the pooch, there were at least parts of his LOTRs movies that wonderfully captured Tolkienâ€™s story, this looks 10 times worse than the Jacksonâ€™s Hobbit mess and that is saying something. I have nothing against making stories that show women and people of color in leading roles, I just ask you write your own instead of forcing a book that wasnâ€™t exactly leading edge 80 year ago into your idea of 2022 politically correctness. Iâ€™ll give this a try but Iâ€™m guessing I wonâ€™t finish the first episode."

Looks like a cheap Witcher knock off. Watch the House of the Dragon trailer - itâ€™s clear HBO listened to their fans and have actually put something decent together that resembles GoT at its peak. This looks over polished cgi rubbish and thereâ€™s nothing Tolkien about it at all
Shame

And another one that doesnt have a clue what he is saying
In 1 minute they managed to make at least 3 major canonical errors. Logically speaking this means the show itself will contain more than 3. Im okay with not seeing that
You can't judge a show because of a trailer. Maybe House of Dragon will be good and Rings of Power bad; maybe the other way around; or maybe they will both suck. I will give Rings of Power a chance and then judge for myself.

"Most people in this comment section have said exactly why they dislike this series if you even bothered to look, and it has nothing to do with muh' racism. So put down your strawman and maybe try engaging honestly with people"
Another one who has no clue what he is saying
"Here's my personal list of grievances:  1) Amazon does not have the rights to the Silmarillion, which covers the time span in which this is all supposed to take place; 2) Amazon called the release date Bilbo's birthday, when it is in fact the anniversary of J.R.R. Tolkien's death; 3) A beardless Dwarf, when Tolkien specifically said that men and women among the Dwarves have beards (and losing one's beard causes a Dwarf such intense shame that they could actually die from it); 4) introducing Hobbits into the most western part of Middle-Earth in the 2nd age, when Tolkien said they didn't show up there until about a thousand years after the start of the 3rd age; and 5) apparently condensing thousands of years of history into a human lifespan.  And that's just the top five.

In short, Amazon have already shown enough disrespect to Tolkien's world and to Tolkien himself that I have no desire to see the series.  And for that, Amazon wants you to believe that I'm just a racist troll."
Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  I literally looked through the comments of this video where people talking about how their  ethnicity doesn't need to be represented and posting that Peter Jackson quote that talked about honoring J.R.R Tolkien and his ideas and how he didn't try to push his own politics. All of this for a teaser that had possibly one character of color. I honestly couldn't even tell due to the lighting. I want to know EXACTLY WHY  regarding in terms of the story why fans of the Tolkien are upset with this teaser. I'm trying to figure whether or not I want to watch the show. If you're going to critique something do it well.
Â @The Other TedÂ  thank you for explaining why you have grievances and the inaccuracies that it has with Tolkien's lore surrounding the LOR. That's all I wanted to know but my point still stands on how several commenters were making it about race and representation on the basis of one character of color.
Â @AE3587Â  I do what I'm talking about because that's literally what the comments are saying.
"Â @bisoleilÂ  Nope you have no clue what you are saying, and you dont even care to know"
"Â @The Other TedÂ  It's good that you have a list of legitimate grievances, particularly 2). Most people here use (false) Tolkien quotes or vague comments.

1) This is true. I hope Amazon can use the appendices.
2) I have looked it up. It's shocking that Amazon chose 2nd September (the day Tolkien died) as release day. I can't confirm that Amazon said that Bilbo's birthday was on that day. Frodo and Bilbo were born on 22nd September; this would be a fitting day to start.
3) The photo of the beardless Dwarf worries me; she just looks so weird. Maybe she shaved herself? Elves do not have beards. The Dwarfs of Khazad-dÃ»m had close relations with the Elves of Eregion, so maybe she wanted to emulate Elfish culture? Or maybe this is just bad writing.
4 and 5) Do you have sources confirming this?"
"Â @The Other TedÂ  Diversity is a thing now. Amazon makes the show ethnically diverse so that they can claim they're progressive and to appease the left. I'm fine with an inclusive cast, including black Elves or Dwarfs, because it doesn't make the show any better or worse. It's a tiny issue compared to the characters and the story."

R. R. Tolkien as a person. Amazon have a track record of representing Christians awfully in their works and so how can we expect them to Faithfully recreate the world invented by a devout catholic.

"disagree, adding hobbits and wizards into the 2nd age would make me think the ""fan"" creating this work doesn't know Middle earth lore at all"
"Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  Why would hobbits being in the Second Age indicate that the fan didn't know the lore?  We know when the Shire was established, but hobbits predated the Shire.  Tolkien himself said we don't know about the origins of hobbits."
"Â @jj48Â  in the 2nd age, the predecessors of the Hobbits, named the harfoots existed, and even if you class them as a type of Hobbit. Tolkien said that this race took no major part in the story of the 2nd age hence why they went unnoticed. So if you are teasing a hobbit or a harfoot alongside a wizard, baring in mind wizards do not travel to Middle Earth until the year 1000 of the thied age, the implication is that that Hobbit / harfoot is central to the story of the 2nd age alongside the Wizard. But none of this took place in Tolkiens mind"
"Â @Mark MacMillanÂ   We don't know exactly what role they'll play in this story.  If they do play a significant, noticeable role, that would be rather odd.  If, however, they're primarily in the background, where whatever they do goes mostly unnoticed by folks, it could fit rather well.

As for the other guy, it's possible he's a wizard, but I don't think that's certain yet.  I want to wait to see where the story's going before I decide how well it works."
"Â @jj48Â  You are right, we don't know. This is of course speculation but it seems to me to be a justifiable speculation (hence why I hold it), but how the company and showrunners have treated Tolkien and his fans already, I can only imagine that whatever they produce will be unfaithful to what Tolkien would have wanted"
"Â @Mark MacMillanÂ   Maybe.  Then again, Jackson's films were unfaithful to how Tolkien likely would have wanted it, and yet I still liked those.  So, I figure I'll give this one a chance, too."
"Â @jj48Â  Obfuscation of the point though isnt it mate. I wasn't referring to Jacksons films, I have my own qualms with them but at least he came out and said he wants to be as faithful as possible to Tolkiens story not adding in his own politics. Conversely the new showrunners wanted to make Middle Earth ""Reflect the modern world"""
"Â @Mark MacMillanÂ   First of all, ""reflecting the modern world"" doesn't say anything about politics, so there's a bit of a logical leap there.

For another thing, this is moving the goalposts.  You said your complaint about the Amazon series was that it'll be ""unfaithful to what Tolkien would have wanted"".  I was merely pointing out that the same could be said of the Jackson films.  Whatever their intentions, I find it hard to believe that Tolkien would have enjoyed the films, based on what he himself said about his works.  If you don't like the looks of what Amazon's doing, then fine.  But let's not pretend it's because they're falling short of ""what Tolkien would have wanted""."

Let's not judge it from the teaser alone. Most of the people who are involved in production have already worked on LOTR movies.  Remember how we didn't want anyone other than John Marston as a protagonist in Red dead redemption. And when Arthur showed up we loved him and burst into tears when he died.

can i sue amazon for damage to my mental health?
I made my grandmotherâ€™s famous apple crisp. I updated the recipe. Instead of white flour I used wheat. Instead of Macintosh I used Granny Smith. Instead of granulated sugar I used brown. Instead of butter I used margarine. Everyone disliked it. I donâ€™t know why.
"ĞĞ¼Ğ°Ğ·Ğ¾Ğ½, ÑƒĞ´Ğ°Ğ»Ğ¸Ñ‚Ğµ ÑÑ‚Ğ¾Ñ‚ Ñ‚Ñ€ĞµĞ¹Ğ»ĞµÑ€ Ğ¸ ÑĞµÑ€Ğ¸Ğ°Ğ», Ğ½Ğµ Ğ¼Ğ¾Ñ€Ğ¾Ñ‡Ñ‚Ğµ Ğ»ÑĞ´ÑĞ¼ Ğ³Ğ¾Ğ»Ğ¾Ğ²Ñƒ. Ğ”Ğ¸Ğ·Ğ»Ğ°Ğ¹Ğº!"

"Who are you making this show for? Because it's definitely not for us Tolkien fans. Amazon, you have failed your business 101."
Dislike
Am i watching Narnia ?
"â€œThere is no curse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of Men for this treachery.â€ â€• J.R.R. Tolkien"
star trek star wars now lord of the rings 3 favorite things of my childhood have now officially watched burn and die into the ground
"â€œThere is no curse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of Men for this treachery.â€ â€• J.R.R. Tolkien"
I'm doing my part lol
Nobody is judging on the teaser alone
Â @AE3587Â  From the comments it seemed so.
"Â @NSÂ  It's the surrounding articles, showrunner comments, release dates, internal hiring / firing practices and superfan videos coupled WITH the teaser trailer that leaves fans without a shadow of a doubt that this will be a series unfaithful to the spirit of Tolkien"
Oh yeah? Like who specifically? Name at least one person.
Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  Lets nor forget people being paid to lie about the show or to shill on it and deleting comments and dislikes
"Â @Piotr SzczepaÅ„skiÂ  no one needs to give you a name. The proof is out there if you want it, but what you want is to defend this show whatever mental gymnastics that will require."
"This def ain't tolkien, this is nothing nearly as good"
Yup
Yeah like a big steaming pile of crap lol
Very accurate
That apple crisp needed representation for the modern message.
Only the story of LOTR is not some recipe from the grandmother.
But that won't be the recipe. It's going to be a different meal. It doesn't matter if you like it or not. It's going to be a different meal
For some reason they think that spoiled gen Z will care and provide them with revenue.
"The originals are still there, it's just that they keep making these new absolute dogshit movies and series"
You are a person of little faith. LOTR has a will of it's own and answers to only one master. It will turn Amazon Prime into wraith.
They just deleted 1.5 million dislikes on this video. Im dead serious. 1.5 million
You're next netflix
SAVE J.R.R. TOLKIEN
Not a single dislikeâ€¦ wow XD
ohhhh no
"For whoever is asking emselves:

"Currently Like to Dislike count is 113k likes to, 1.5 million dislikes.  Bezos, you couldn't afford to bribe half of the Tolkien fandom to fall for this crap."
"30M views 113k likes, lmfao lucky they removed dislikes"
"My brothers.

I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me.

A day may come when the courage of fans fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day.

THIS DAY WE FIGHT!

By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, TRUE FANS."
whooa...113K LIKE ! Not bad .
Which tolkin fan shat in your cereal?
Looks like garbage another show i wont be watching
1.5 million dislikes
Wir nehmen einfach die Serie und werfen sie in den Schicksalsberg ?
How does one see dislikes I have seen cc have dislikes on their videos  about trailers or reactions.
"â€œThere is no curse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of Men for this treachery.â€ â€• J.R.R. Tolkien"
Fucking blasphemy
amazon is going to replays the cover of the books with new that saw the rings of power . amazon you can't change the hestorie just another failure. but it's ok it's your money not ours
"Subscriptions shall be shaken, dislikes shall be splintered, an Amazon-day, a red day, ere the sun rises! Ride now, ride now, ride! Ride for ruin and the world's ending!"
"I liked two fandoms, Halo and Tolkienâ€¦. 
â€¦ 
â€¦ 
I donâ€™t like any fandoms anymore."
I see 1.5 million dislikes to 113k likes do you mean there were 3 million before?
"Â @ShayÂ  yes, there were literally three million dislikes. They deleted over half of them"
It was actually 3 million dislikes but they removed half of them
1.6m now
"Add ""Return YouTube Dislike"" plugin to your Chrome."

"Galadrial was a wizard-class elf with max INT... now you make her with high STR too? That's stupid

"They're purging comments and dislikes, nice...."
What an absolute agenda driven piece of trash failure. I hope it costs them billions in a flop.
No thank you
Dislike please ?
"It just sucks because you have to be a non dedicated fan in order to like what theyre doing. They dont have the core fan base in mind and it shows. If they didnt have the name lord of the rings strapped on this id be more open. But its like theyre going out of their way to change as much of tolkiens universe as possible. No lotr fan ever asked for that. Theres a true heart and soul that come from these stories. And  honestly if you think about it they take the femininity away from galadrial and turn her into a ""fierce"" warrior when shes is actually a divine goddess practicly. She doesnt need a fucking sword she can turn you into particles with just a flick of her wrist (way more fucking baddass), and then you take away the femininity of male elves by taking their long hair, (male elves should be almost mistaken as females lol)then you take away the masculinity from the female dwarves  with removing their beards. Its like you could have taken advantage of these suprising progressive ideas but you completely blow it by doing the opposite. Also in all honestly you read the lord of the rings or even watch the movies you can see that amazons views and power contradicts the heart of these stories."
"The show producers are doubling down on rejecting the real Tolkien fans, ignoring and denigrating their opinions and hoping that they can appeal to some other group like maybe Game of Thrones fans, or Wheel of time fans. Bad news is seasons 7 and 8 of GoT killed off most of the GoT fans and Wheel of Time has already proved that if you drive off the existing fanbase, even for a big franchise, fantasy doesnt have a broad enough appeal to drag in and hook enough casual viewers to make a profit. Stand by for a butchering of Tolkien's work which will also be a financial disaster. Mr Bezos wished for his own Game of Thrones and thats what he has got. But sadly its season 8 Game of Thrones.... muddled, badly written and not worth watching"
whats the issue lol it looks cool
You legit removed my dislike....wtf. I hope the free peoples stand against you foul Bezos.
dead meme
"I think Galadriel Was at least part cleric, this radiant damage attaks against evil?"
Â @Marcin DybowskiÂ  still high INT job... now she's high DEX and high STR :/
Galadriel as barbarian...
You have my sword!
Currently at 1.5 Million dislikes
it won't be lol
Amazon Prime is now bribing and corrupting content creators and influencers (Fellowship of the Fans) to vomit out false praise and to explain away the lore breaking. How much did it take for these 'fans' to betray the spirit of Tolkien?
Why donÂ´t you just give it a different name? Like 'Lord of the springs'. There see. Problem solved. Why do you have to ruin everything that is good?
1500 000 dislikes)) FU Amazon!
The Lord of the Cringe
I am quite sure Youtube is blocking dislikes. It's been stuck at 1.5 mln dislikes for 2 weeks already. Hated video not gaining any more dislikes. That is an event of low probability. Especially if you compare it to the increasing number of views.
Lol I don't even need to see the dislikes to know that this probably has about a million lmao...have yourll not learned from spiderman that fans is what give yourll money....i will not be watching this at all
wtf is this?
I can't wait for this to come out so i can shitpost about it everywhere
Yeah.. I'm going to watch the original Trilogy when this comes out
Lul. They removed the dislikes.
Back up to 1.5 million dislikes as of 5/4/22. Only 113 thousand likes.
Just please no...
"TO BE HONEST ITS A EPIC TRAILER AND ALL BUT AS A TOLKIEN FAN THOSE FOUR CHARACTERS THAT SPOKE ABOUT THE SHOW JUST HUMILIATED TOLKIEN UNIVERSE , I BELEAVE THAT IF THEY HAD TO ACT IN THIS SERIES AMAZON WOULD LOOSE OUT ON ALOT AS FOR THEM NOT TO KNOW ABOT LOTR ORIGINAL MOVIES AND THE HOBBIT BREAKS OUR HEART AND COULD EVEN RUIN LOTR FOR THE REST OF THE FANS OUT THERE THAT THINK THERE IS STILL HOPE."
Rip [*]
1.5 million dislikes says it all
"Honestly, whether or not it follows the lore, still excited for a new fantasy tv series! Still going to watch it!"
"We don't want Game of Thrones. 
We don't want The Witcher. 
We don't want politics. 
We don't want modern interpretation. 
We want Tolkien. 
We want Middle Earth.
We want The Lord Of The Rings."
"Lost for words, this looks so trash beyond imagination. Im heart broken </3"
the agenda ruins everything
delete it all
"To betray something first you have to believe in it, or follow it. Those 'fans' never did either, most likely."
"And the shadow ban the real ones. This is losing attitude. Fellowship of the Fans doesn't represent Tolkien fans, they are just content creators, nothing more, no need them at all."
because amazon is like parasite
Lords of the Rainbow :)
"In reality is more, were 3 mil downvotes and they erase it."
"Perhaps a lot of those who disliked it, disliked it so much that they clicked the Dislike button again ;-)"
"Â @AlichinoGamingÂ  I did, many times but much like the MÃ»makil , it still only counts as one!"
AS DO DIVERSITY ISSUES THEY SHOULD HAVE KEPT IT THE SAME NOT CHANGED IT ....
"GamÄ™ of Thrones and Witcher both are great masterpieces - books, of course. It is sad, that they were butchered as films"
Pretty much.
Â @Marcin DybowskiÂ  the first four seasons of got are masterclass
"Â @Franci LaudaÂ  May be true, just wish they could keep it up."
"If you really wanted Tolkien, you'd know it's spelled ""Middle-earth"" not ""Middle Earth."""
I want House of the Dragons actually
Â @Marcin DybowskiÂ  You know nothin Jon Snow!!
"Â @Architect DeckedÂ  but House of Dragons is actually based on something, so it should not be that bad imo"
Â @Marcin DybowskiÂ  me too
Â @Franci LaudaÂ  I also like the 5th and 6th one...
"Remember GOT IS GOAT. If the ending you don't like, it's totally up to you. Martin make it and also end it his own way."
"Â @Juboraz AhmedÂ  the first four seasons are the best things ever shown in a tv series.
Obviously it is only my humble opinion"
The Witcher is amazing
Â @Darkk_VibesÂ  only the game and the book the series is only ok
"Â @Marcin DybowskiÂ  Witcher had movie I do remember series with Henry and it's awesome. 
GoT was good until S7."
Â @MaggottheSicÂ  Yeah ofc. The source material is already completed by Martin and that's the best thing as it reduces the risk of crash landing in the end like GoT. This is why I think people should actually give HOTD a shot at least  and I m pretty sure it's gonna be as epic as GoT was in its early days coz everyone that made GoT so epic is involved like director Miguel sapochnik and Ramin of course!
Â @Franci LaudaÂ  depends on what you like I personally like the changes (for show) and also If Netflix didnâ€™t change certain details from the book and game then the Witcher would never have the audience netflix needed it to have to fund a 15 million per episode budget.  Netflixes Witcher adaption has helped the Witcher games/books in general from exposure check sales of the games and books when the show gets attraction they go up Which is good for the overall health of both kinds of the Witcher
Too late for that now!!
yea but not this one.
Iâ€™m routing for the show to fail and flop so hard
â€‹Â @Marcin DybowskiÂ  films?
Enjoyed most of got and enjoyed the witcher but havnt seen the 2nd season yet
got is goat
Â @brooksboy78Â  it literally doesn;t matter
Well I just cancelled Amazon...
"Turning Middleearth into Weak Men, ""Strong Females"", Black Elves... Sounds like Saurons Masterplan to conquer the world."
Anyone care to tell me the dislike number please
"Your show is going to burn - We're all going to laugh - Then you're going to blame us.

Lmao the dislikes ğŸ¤£
Why does this trailer feel Disney-esque? Are they planning on milking this IP to death hmmmm....
You! Shall not pass!! ...into my screens
OVER 3 MILLION DISLIKES! ğŸ‘
One thing that I dislike about this is that you couldn't tell which is an elf at first glance. They lost their mystical and ethereal vibe.
Horrible
"i think Tolkien work is done from lord of the ring, idk why writers are still making lord of the rings even though no will watch it cuz the old actors are not in it so it will be a failure for all and no one will watch it cuz it sucks"
now 1.5m was recently 8m+
Looks bad
"Looks like Amazon decided to take everything wrong with the hobbit (tokenism, excessive CGI, cramming the plot with unnecessary details) and decided it would work with a TV show. The bechdel test is a waste of time."

Lol you should have named this to Narnia. Has nothing to do with Lord of the rings.
EstÃ£o destruindo um legado.
PÃ©ssimo
Don't go watching it out of curiousity if you are against it as a true Tolkien fan just to see how garbageit is that will only empower their cause and disrespect for tolkien.
"If [Zimmerman] and/or others do so, they may be irritated or aggrieved by the tone of many of my criticisms. If so, I am sorry (though not surprised). But I would ask them to make an effort of imagination sufficient to understand the irritation (and on occasion the resentment) of an author, who finds, increasingly as he proceeds, his work treated as it would seem carelessly in general, in places recklessly, and with no evident signs of any appreciation of what it is all about. ....

The canons of narrative an in any medium cannot be wholly different ; and the failure of poor films is often precisely in exaggeration, and in the intrusion of unwarranted matter owing to not perceiving where the core of the original lies J.R.R. Tolkien"
Like Cowboy Bebop
"Until more dislikes are removed, that is."
It's not even worth torrenting.
"There are screenshots of them being at three million.  If the video is too disliked, it won't appear before other videos criticizing it, so they won't be permitted to go above a certain level."
Â @Matt42MSGÂ  that makes sense! Interesting
"If I end up watching this out of morbid curiosity, I will definitely be sailing the high seas. Not a dime for Amazon."
If I watch it... it will only be on EFAP!
"Â @SS900FÂ  Oh definitely! The first thing I'm going to do is seeing my favorite YouTubers laugh at it. The crew at EFAP will tear it to shreds, and will be watching Nerdrotic too, he read one of my comments on his Livestream and I was so happy!! ğŸ˜„"
Thank you for posting this!
A stain on J.R.R tolkiens legacy.
It actually looks like a good show  IF it wasn't related to LotR.
How do i dislike multiple times? I still feel like my dislike is not enough
Stop deleting comments!
"Today - 113k like, 1.6m dislike. As Agent Smith would say in The Matrix Reloaded when fighting Neo - More!"
This proves Amazon doesnâ€™t care to create quality content. Honestly I believe for tax reasons they would be happy to take a loss on this series. It just makes it so they can keep not paying taxes.
How could you have done this - tommy wiseow
"â€œBut as the theme progressed, it came into the heart of Melkor to interweave matters of his own imagining that were not in accord with the theme of IlÃºvatar, for he sought therein to increase the power and glory of the part assigned to himself.â€ - The Silmarilion by J.R.R. Tolkien"
I wonder why YouTube really removed the dislikes ...
And do You know what a dwarf would say to that? Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul!
This is garbage...
This will start the new age of adventure series that we need am stick of today tv series and web series we need something like lord of rings ohh man I waited so long for this

1.5 millon dislike right now and they removed 40k comments that we know of.
It had 3.1M dislikes last month
Amen.
Amen brother ğŸ‘
It will fail and there not getting away with it because people will see the bs of Amazon
Â @jesÂ  Yep it did and like the comments they removed the amount of dislikes too
How does one see the dislikes?
"Â @A RÂ  get the extension ""return youtube dislike"""
1.6mil dislikes now. :D
It used to be 3 million dislikes.
How do you see the dislikes?
LOTR fans!!! Lock your shields!!!
"They ruined wheel of time too. I couldnâ€™t get through a full episode, was so weird and cringe."
"Â @jesÂ  The extension that shows dislikes, can experience issues in its estimation at times. Which is why it showed 3M briefly. It also only showed a hundred thousand for a very long time too, before jumping up to over 1 Million. Basically it's guessing the dislikes. It's not always going to be accurate, although tests show it's usually within 5% accuracy."
Lol. Legal? Call the internet police!!
"What a travesty against a truly magnificent series...it'll be great to see this series crash and burn, but it would be far better if they'd actually made something that honored Tolkien's legacy."
"LOTR will soon have a speaking of parrot, whatta joke"
I wish this video could put on the one ring and go invisible so my eyes stop bleeding
"â€œThere is no curse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of Men for this treachery.â€ â€• J.R.R. Tolkien"
"Tolkien's work has always been so special to me, ever since my Dad first read me the Hobbit as a child. To see something so sacred and, dare I say 'precious', bastardised in order to pander to the whims of a Smaugian lunatic and a small minority of ardent social media addicts, is just plan sad. No man needs such wealth as the world burns. Leave our heartfelt fandom alone. Now!"

A DAY MAY COME WHEN THE COURAGE OF MEN FAILS FUCKING LOVE THAT WE STAND TOGETHER
"Everyone's talking about black elves, dwarves etc. No one's talking about how shitty the show looks. I still wouldn't watch this if everyone was snow white."
"And again: DislikeğŸ‘ğŸ¼
Not a single â€˜influencerâ€™ from tik tok or paid critics will change my opinion, my feelings and my disappointment"
I honestly don't care about black elves or that bullshit what I care about is non bearded dwarf women. WTF I'm pretty sure its been established that all dwarves have beards. Male and female.
"The goblins are back at it again, desecrating western icons"
"'havent you ever wondered what else is out there?'

somehow i knew i hated it by the time i heard this line, thats just impressive amazon"
1.5mil dislikes you go you :D
Who needs to see the dislike button? A trailer with 30 million views and only 113k likes? that in itself tells a story that they can't hide.
"After the 3rd Hobbit movie, it is an end of an era. I dream of the released of The Silmarillion live action but it seems that greedy studios would rather retcon Lord of the Rings than give us the finale series/movie which is The Silmarillion.

I'm no purist but this new series does not belong to Middle Earth the same way Tauriel shouldn't have been a major character."
"Subsequently, Peter Jackson took a dumb on the books"
"Â @ReekÂ  no he didn't and if you're defending this show  you have no room to throw any stones at Peter Jackson's movies, because this show has negative zero respect for Tolkien's books."
Â @L NAPHÂ  He did tho. â€œI AM NO MAN!â€
Â @breadordecideÂ  nope.  The movies were tasteful and respectful
Is that a Devil Survivor avatar?
"basically, they have changed so much that this doesnt even resemble the original thing. Plus, they have needlessly changed the elves  actors to black actors, even though in lotr elves are very clearly said to be white. Combined with the fact that this has no soul, people are very very angry."
Â @Levi AthanÂ  ah ok thanks for explaining
"Many people just want to complain about movies and series. There have been few large movies and series to complain about the past two years, so they now complain about a series which hasn't aired yet."
"Â @Levi AthanÂ  ''they have changed so much that this doesnt even resemble the original thing.''
How do you know this? Do you have any source?"
"Â @ReekÂ  I read the original books, along with the Hobbit. They got rid of most of the old cast, replaced them with a ""diverse and bold"" cast, i.e black actors. They even went as far as to retcon the elves into being black. I get that representing colored people in media is important, but this is plain nonsensical. If they wanted to put black people into lotr, they should have added a new kingdom with black people."
"They have basically thrown out the story Tolkien wrote, making up their own  and messing up the main characters."
"Â @Levi AthanÂ  It is great that you have read the Lord of the Rings books and The Hobbit.

Then about the diverse cast. As far as I know Tolkien describes the Elves as being fair-skinned. I don't know whether he said that all Elves are white, but the Elves he described were said to be fair-skinned, so I think we can assume he considered them white.


The show is not canon. I have accepted black Elves, as long as they are well-written characters and actually seem and behave like Elves.

And when did they get rid of the old cast?"
Â @Levi AthanÂ   Representing colored people in media is not important to me.
This series is set in the future. So they had to write a whole new set of characters
It has been stablished elves were very pale...
I care about about fact they are rewriting the story and destroying the main characters.
"Yep.  Outsiders rarely realize they've encountered a dwarven woman; there is essentially no dimorphism between male and female dwarves besides the most basic, necessary differences.  As long as everyone keeps their clothes on, we'd never be able to tell.  Really, they missed an opportunity to cast men as female dwarves and call it a victory for trans acceptance!"
SAME
"Wtf is this. We asked for Silmarillion, not ths s#!t"
not big into LOTR why does everyone hates this
Can we collectively agree not to watch this and we'll all just act like it did not happen so maybe someone who actually knows what he is doing can do justice to this pile of donkey pee and poopoo.
L Amazon
Why not make your own fantasy universe instead of bastardizing someone else's work?
My parents supported this adaptions. I will divorce them first chance i get.
This is nothing remotely Tolkien. This is just offal at best.
"horrible, what have they done!"
113k likes and 1.5M dislikes says something. but unfortunately the writers are blind and deaf.

Can't wait to see LOTR go the way of Star Wars. Perfect. :/
"Such a shame to do that, dislike from Egypt ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¬"
Boooooo Boooooo! This was an easy slam dunk and you blew it! Shame on you.
This looks horrible.
"They don't have rights to the simarillion, so they decided to make up their own story ğŸ’ğŸ½â€â™€ï¸"
"Even not being an LOTR fan, you can see how bad this trailer is. Compare it to Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit movie trailer, you'll understand the cringe. Also for years, LotR fans asked for ""The Silmarillion"" which is the ""climax"" of the Middle Earth saga but instead they give us a new, sh1tty, unoriginal story instead."
"Destroying the story and main characters. They don't have rights to the time im thr show they are representing, so they had to make stuff up  and are not following the little little do have rights to. They are making main characters super lame, and not even following what they do/who they are."
Sad thing is millions of people is gonna watch and enjoy it.
Â @Thor BeornÂ  Exactly so we gotta watch it and tell them why it's bad.
Â @Mister WabbitÂ  you haven't even seen it.
"Â @ReekÂ  Again, there is no need to see it. Stop making excuses to shill on amazon"
"Â @AE3587Â  Jeff Bezos is giving me a big paycheck to defend the show. You will see it, even if you say you won't."
"Â @ReekÂ  Nope i will not see it, you can try and guess all you want, that all you people can do"
Â @AE3587Â  You will see it.
"Â @ReekÂ  I'm sure that's true, as you are everywhere defending this show."
"Â @ReekÂ  No i will not, you can keep repeating it. You have no clue what you are talking about"
Â @L NAPHÂ  And I'm not even defending this show. I just think the show should be judged after it's aired.
"Â @ReekÂ  you're defending it pretty hard... not just on this trailer, but on other videos. Why?"
"Â @ReekÂ  There is more than enough information to be able to judge it before it airs, again stop talking about what you dont know"
Â @ReekÂ  And if you paid any attention to tolkien you would know that he doesnt like this kind of adaptation
Â @AE3587Â  What information? Do you have credible sources?
Â @AE3587Â  J.R.R. Tolkien almost certainly wouldn't like the show. Tolkien has noted once Lord of the Rings isn't suitable for adaptations. I know Christopher Tolkien didn't like the LotR movies.
Â @ReekÂ  If you dont know then why do you talk? ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
Because names bring attention.
Money.
"That would require creativity and effort, two attributes which are evidently absent from most working in Hollyweird today."
EXACTLY! thanks
Producer:Mairon and Annatar
because not even their mother would see them
tbh i am extremely dissapointed and feel kindda betrayed
I would  too.
How can you not see the problem?! They've changed EVERYTHING. There's nothing left of Tolkien's work!
Seems to be what a lot of people are doing
"Â @More PleaseÂ  Go try and understand the reason why, then come back"
"Don't get the backlash to this yet UNRELEASED tv series - because some characters have dark skin and they shouldnt? Because the female dwarfs dont have beards? You do realise people that it is FANTASY, It would be nice to see you channel this energy to solve actual issues we have in our real lives."
God I wish I could see that dislike amount
They're gonna loose a lot of money.
"The Lord of the Amazon: ""Come not between a nazgul and his prey!""
Lady Eowyne: ""Begone foul dwimmerlaik, Lord of Carrion! Leave the Dead in Peace!""
Amazon: ""Thou Fool! No man may hinder me!
Lady Eowyn removes her helmet to reveal a multitude of faces beneath, shining bright and fiercely, as flame rekindled.
Lady Fanbase: ""I am no man!""
And Lady Fanbase plunges the sword into the empty void where a head might have been and the Lord of the Amazon fell dead upon the earth, armor cracking and crumbling away to dust."
Why'd they call it the rings of power .... that's literally the post credit scene of the silmarilian.
This is going to suck so bad.

STOP THE COLLECTIVE ASSASSINATION OF GREAT FRANCHISES NOW!!!"
There was a time when I was incredibly excited for this. I was naÃ¯ve enough to think that they would do something like Peter Jackson and the movies. Will not be watching this mockery of Tolkien's work
Remember the good days when people were excited for movie adaptations?
1.5 million dislikes
i have a original hard back copy of the hobbit if amazon wana use that for references and lore and character development that is needed
"It's Tolkien's world, he created the well-established races and characters. His dream was to create a mythology for England, he was inspired a lot by Norse mythology. His characters are based on English people. Darker skinned Elves are olive colored like Mediterranean people (Arabs), drawn women have beards, Amazon could focus on Harad people to make these changes. But the most important thing is not the skin color, it's the lore changes, they made Galadriel a warrior, but she is a powerful sorceress, in the second age she was married Celeborn and had a daughter Celebrian, the series made her much more young, and probably single. They're making Gandalf come in the second age, but he's just come in the third age. Amazon could create their on world, not destroy a very stabilish world. They could creat series about African, Egyptian, Arab, Indian or Asian cultures, not change European culture. I'm Brazilian, I don't want Brazilian Vikings, that don't make any sense, that aren't representative, nor do I want them to change our history to adapt to today's political agenda. A true fan doesn't need be represented to enjoy a good story, I'm not an Elf, Dwarf, Hobbit, Wizard or Numenorean, but I can empathize with them. Tolkien's culture must be respected, as well as his work must be preserved."
Â @Gabriel FilletiÂ  Hear hear!
Finally someone saying this.
"Â @ReekÂ  I think this has been explained thousands of times in this comment section alone, by people from all continents."
"Â @Tuomas HuuhtanenÂ  I have seen many vague comments. Only a few of them are well thought off. Most are just (real and fake) quotes from Tolkien and complaints like ''black elves'', ''black dwarfs'', ''new characters'' and ''it differs from the book''."
Â @ReekÂ  you've been here a week.
Unless you are breadordecide...... which is quite possible.
"Â @ReekÂ  This is supposed to be a mythological past of Europe, but they turned it to reflect modern California. An equivalent would be to multiculturalize something like Mulan and call everyone who disagrees -ists. You don't need to be racial supremacist to think it's not only silly, but also disrespectful towards the cultures and people who created them, and who those works were supposed to reflect.

I get it, America is a mess politically, and to force multiculturalism in to absolutely everything serves some propagandist purpose domestically. Just keep the foreign cultural landmarks out of it, do it with Batman or something, or create new IPs or entirely."
"How many of them have actually read the books?
And how many only dislike because of politics?"
"Â @ReekÂ  Have YOU read ALL the books? If not, be quiet."
"Â @Bite MeÂ  I have read most of the books. I have read The LotR trilogy, the appendices of that book, The Hobbit, The Silmarillion, The Children of Hurin, The Fall of Gondolin and Unfinished Tales. I'm planning to read The Tale of Beren and Luthien, but I will have to buy the book first.
Have you read any of the books? If yes, which ones have you read?"
"Sons of Gondor!
Of Rohan!
My brothers.
I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me.
A day may come when the courage of Men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day.
An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the Age of Men comes crashing down, but it is not this day!
This day we fight!
By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, for Tolkien!"
"I like how you're fighting so hard to keep it below 50k comments, and below 1.6 million dislikes, Amazon. Hopefully, your employees whose fingers are likely bleeding from keeping it that way are being paid overtime."
"this looks bad, i'll stick with the trilogy."
"Tolkien: no one touches elves' hair!
Amazon: a character we invented will pull Galadriel's hair!"
"The Lord of the Rings will no longer be the same, there is no point in releasing more movies about it"
i like to party
"Just for anyone who doesn't have a dislike counter mod on their browser, current count is 1.5 million dislikes to 113k likes."
I really hope this isn't in reality the definitive feminist manifesto...
"I don't like it. You can delete my comment. Amazon, start paying taxes in lands you are earning money in. But the trailer, I dislike for itself."
"Shame on you amazon, shame on you."
ğŸ‘113K ğŸ‘1.6M   For those who cant see the dislikes... That means they have been removing dislikes according to previous comments
Booo
Go back to the Shadow. You shall not pass!
"May 2, 2022
113K likes vs 1.5 m dislikes lol"
"as of today (02 May), we got 113K likes and 1,5 million dislikes. Well done Amazon. it seems EVERYONE just LOVES this sh... show..."
Respect Tolkien legacy. For too long I was watching my favourite franchises beeing devoured and destroyed. And now LOTR universe? No way. Make it stop.
"bring it down, bring it down, BRING IT DOWN!!!"
For everyone that doesn't know there is an extension which brings dislikes back and it misses some so maybe a few hundred thousand off but the video currently has 1.5million dislikes at the very least.
"You should be ashamed of yourselves, Amazon Prime Video and Vanity Fair. This is not respectful. This is not a necessary ""update to the racial and gender dynamics"" of the Lord of the Rings and other J.R.R. Tolkien's works. This is not an epic story to capture the hearts of fans. This is monstrous drivel riding on a name that should be held sacrosanct because of the enormous pioneering legacy involved.

Write your own shows and leave Our Precious alone, pretty please. IF you can do that?"
When this comes out I'm gonna watch something else! So excited!
"Indeed. After the end of the 3rd Hobbit movie, it is an end of an era. My dream was the released of the Silmarillion but it seems that greedy studios would rather retcon The Lord of the Rings than give us The finale series/movie which is The Silmarillion."
"Weird, I see 1.5M"
"You haven't seen the show yet. It may suck, but it can also be great."
"Â @ReekÂ  and I don't need to see the show yet to have an opinion, contrary to what you clearly think. I already know, thanks to plenty of research, that this is not going to be something I will want to watch. Please leave me be, if you want to watch it, by all means - just don't think you can or should pressure me into it."
Â @The Obscure RamblerÂ  show the research
"Â @ReekÂ  No, thank you. Who do you think you are, making demands from me? ğŸ˜‚ Do your own and _leave me alone_, as I asked you, thanks."
"You will watch. Most of us will watch, especially those who say that they will not watch."
"Â @ReekÂ  I'll probably watch eventually, but not out of genuine interest, more like morbid curiosity. Just to see how badly they ruin it."
"Â @ReekÂ  Naah I've cancelled my amazon prime and if I've made it this far without watching GoTs final season despite loving the earlier ones, I can avoid this"
"So you have begun to wonder what else is out there. Me too, the first seconds of this made me want to take a closer look at Korean cinema."
"Â @SmallasaurusÂ  You will watch it when it airs. Then you will say it sucked, but you'll eagerly wait for season 2."
Â @ReekÂ  I have no clue what you're talking about. Are you upset over something or just trying to be a contrarian?
CRINGE
Someone should swear an oath of vengeance like FÃ«anor did.
"I canceled amazon prime, free shipping from an overworked, underpaid, with little benefits amazon employee, and, delivery drivers that accept the water I offer in the heat of summer because of the company's inhuman practices and grueling schedules, are not worth it when it's funding this abomination to a great established work of fantasy literature and lore.
That's where I draw the line."
Guys let's just watch it first before we judge it ok?
"Rip, my lovely world"
"I mean we had 20 years without LOTR so I take it, I guess"
This is just shame
Iâ€™m Wait this serial so many times and now I see so shat
This is a terrible
1.6M dislikes vs 113k likes ! I love this !!
Video could rather be named: â€œThe ring of special snowflakesâ€
What an absolute disaster. No thank you.
Amazon! Give the ring back to frodo
"When it's the credits: I wonder if they'll put it in Aniron, the way of it was put in the Peter Jackson Films."
Nearly 30 million views and still can't make it to 150 thousand likes .  This series is going to be a billion dollar disaster for Amazon .
"11+ Million dislikes.

I love Democracy."
It just sucks that they are destroying all the things I really liked.
Ridiculous...
"Its impressive that yall keep deleting dislikes. It was at 1.8m dislikes Apr 7th, somehow 1.5m dislikes today. How do yall do it?"
Oh god please no
What about no?
"Yeah, and let's also drink lighter fluid before we say it tastes bad"
"okay, how about only YOU watch it then tell us if its good or not, which we then wont watch either way"
"There does seem to be a lot of some form of strange virtue signalling going on in people dissing this trailer. It's like they want to be seen saying they don't like it more than they want to do what it logically takes to form a proper personal judgment of a thing.

Trailer looked good to me. It's set a long time before LoTR, it's going to be a bit of a different world to what we saw in LoTR. Black elves? So what? Galadriel is a bit of a roaming adventurer in the second age? Meh, I'll wait and see how they explain that one before I get annoyed at mischaracterisations like that.

Sure, they might whiff things but we can't really say they have until it's released and we watch it."
"Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  Yea I only meant LOTR, not Hobbit if that makes sense xD"
"Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  Difficult xD 
Iâ€˜ll give it a go though. Even though it definitely wonâ€˜t be as good as the original movies."
have you seen it yet?
Â @ReekÂ  With everything going on its pretty clear that it is an absolute disaster. Pay more attention next time
"They're using the Prime Ring. Around Bezos' finger. With their equivalent to Wormtongue, whose last name is Wojcicki to keep ramming the delete button."
"Guys donâ€™t google this show, donâ€™t watch it or express any interest. Thatâ€™s how we kill it, pls ignore it as much as itâ€™s possible."
"This shell of a story had nothing to do with the great world of Tolkien. Slapping a famous name on a random product wonâ€™t get you money. We donâ€™t need rewriting or fixing, the story is perfect as it was written. Stop rewriting culture. You wonâ€™t tarnish his legacy. this is not going to be remembered. This is not the great silmarillion"
Just a fyi since youtube is hiding the dislikes now: the video currently has 1.5 million dislikes vs 113k likes as of May 2nd 2022.
I donâ€™t want to judge this too early but this teaser didnâ€™t excite me at all.
"Looking forward to the political agendas 

""Middle earth is dying, we must increase the Carbon tax"" 

""You shall not pass!!!.... without a vaccine pass."""
"Hahaha good joke, just shows 0 writing talent. We saw what happened to game of thrones. Now it's lord of the rings turn. 
All they do is hijack someone else's success and writing skill and turn it into something Ridiculous. 
They can't come up with original stories, they can't make original characters. 
All they can do is modify.
 I am glad I read the original  books. Don't need to waste time on this."
Thank God Tolkien doesn't have to see this.
Pushes dislike button â€œfor Frodoâ€
"Did you know Amazon will release this series on September 2nd at the same date Tolkien died? They don't respect Tolkien, they want to destroy his work."
This is how you get your show pirated.
I'm a religious person and I will always be against evil that destroys my religion or any light based on it in our world. J. R. R. Tolkien is like a prophet to me and I will fight for him until the end of time.
All I can think is W. T. F.?
Letâ€™s not deify Tolkien and render his works untouchableâ€¦ I donâ€™t even mind spin-offs that warp his universeâ€¦ this just happens to look like dogshit
Wow this looks horrible wtf
wow 1.5m dislikes to 113k likes what a shame they trying to destroy Tolkien's work serves them right
"It doesnâ€™t feel like a Middle-earth cinematic adaptation at all. It doesnâ€™t have the Tolkien vibes. Not only that, but the plot isnâ€™t close to what Tolkien wrote, and there are more invented characters than original written characters. What a waste of money and time."
sauron couldn't destroy middle earth but amazon did
"If you want a series to reflect your vision of 2022, create your own material.  But that is not their true purpose."
Worst show ever. Thanks Amazon
Alright this convinced me to rewatch the OG Tolkien movies to get this one evicted out of my head
You have my sword.
Â @ScreamingreenÂ  and you have my bow
And my ax
That doesn't sound like you're very religious
Â @StridewiseÂ  I'm actually Muslim. I studied Islam for 3 years when I was a kid. The middle earth trilogy is generally connected to the abrahamic history of the before-mankind age in many aspects.
Diiiiiislike
"Thanks amazon , i am happy today"
ğŸ–• Amazon for destroying a classic!  I'll be watching Peter Jackson's extended trilogy on September 2.
Delete my comment on this trash. Do it pooosey
Cancel this.
"Fxck this timeline, I'm outâœŒ"
Poor Tolkien
"It is just painful to see one of the greatest (maybe the greatest) stories and fantasy world ever created, being disfigured and so badly"
"There really is no hope for cinema.
It's all just money laundering at this point and they validate the legitimacy of these cancerous projects by making controversial decisions in terms of actors and story so they can blame the absolute flop on incels, racists, homophobes, bigots etc.
The only ""good"" movies that will come out from now on will be slowburn indie movies with some shred of sense in casting and story(at least for the first 2 acts) with an ambiguous ending. Can't say I complain but they will eventually get dull if they haven't already."

Â @mokopaÂ  I BID YOU TO STAND! MAN OF THE WEST!
I don't get what's so bad here? It looks fun
Â @rolldemTREESÂ  Read LOTR first and then you'll understand why its bad...
Â @Carson NesbitÂ  Have read lotr and I still don't think the trailer is bad. People judge and shitstorm so early nowadays. The show isn't even out yet
"Â @Vivien AubkeÂ  I have to agree to the second half of you comment, that is absolutely true"
ğŸ˜‚
"This story is set in the second age. From the start of the second age to the start of the third age it's ~3500 years. Then it's another ~3000 years until the events of LotR. My guess, without knowing much about it, is that this tv show is probably set roughly 4000-5000 years before LotR. At the start of the second age Morgoth had just been defeated and Sauron didn't make the rings of power until 1500 years into the age. 

This story could be covering the rise of Sauron following the defeat of Morgoth or it could be something else altogether, but my money's on that it's about Sauron being a sneaky one and tricking everyone. Or it could be a series of leaps through time. They've got elves that have lived all the way through the events to assist as narrative anchors.


Whether they're getting Galadriel right: Well... they've cast an actress who looks a fair bit like Galadriel looked in the movie... Character wise though, Galadriel certainly did become a stately leader before Sauron made the rings but we can't really say she was this all the way through the first and second ages. At the start of the second age she was a banished rebel despite being elven royalty. She was one of the ones who'd much earlier wanted to travel to middle-earth to explore and set up personal kingdoms there away from the elven homelands and she'd refused to return to the elven homelands when invited to.

She didn't even start using the ring of power that she'd been given until the events with Isildur led to the one ring being lost, which is the point that marks the end of the 2nd age. She never used it before then because she didn't trust the one who gave it to her even before it was revealed that he was Sauron. While she was pretty strong in the magical department before, the magically very powerful form you see her in the movies doesn't really come about until after she starts using the ring. Just with that info there we can definitely say she should not be the same in this series as she is in LotR.

I'd say there's plenty of room enough in what Tolkien described about the first to second age for Galadriel to have been a warrior for a spell. They'll get her wrong if they pretend that she's not already spent time as a leader, portray her as battle hungry or not making every effort to avoid wars but the idea of her spending some time as an armed protector and roamer during this era would be well within character scope. As for the ninja stuff, meh, Tolkien's elves were always like that.

Personally I want to see some of the stuff explaining how the elves actually got the worst deal from Eru, who gave the younger races the gift of mortality and a certain freedom that he didn't give to the elves (they have to wait a very long time for this freedom even after they die), or even just a reference to it."
How do I see the dislikes?
My dislike was removed - I put it back thanks for trying
poor amazon... now they are even deleting critical comments :Â´)
"Yikes, this looks cringe.  At least we have the originals.  I will just pretend this doesn't exist."
"113k likes / 1,5 mil dislikes.. says a lot"
wow that's a lot of dislikes. I probably shouldn't watch it then.
"Two words "" beep this"""
Looks like the worst piece of despicable crap I couldâ€™ve ever imagined. This has got nothing to do with Tolkienâ€™s TLOTR.
This is an abomination
This is trash. Same thing was done to The Witcher saga by netflix.
What a clusterfuck.
Another Masterpiece that is getting ruined by diversity
What is a total budget of this series ???
This looks nothing like lord of the rings
Treat this comment as a dislike button guys. upvote this comment guys to show dislikes. Amazon has no right to hijack Tolkien's and Jackson's masterpiece
"It began with the forging of the Great Films. Rights were given to Peter Jackson, Immortal, Wisest and Fairest of all beings.

The other rights given to the MGM Lords, great history of the film halls. 

But we were all deceived for another adaptation was made...

In the land of Amazon in the fires of Mount Doom the Dark Lord Bezos created in secret a terrible series adaptation. 

And into this series he poured his money, his greed and his will to dominate existing franchises with political ideology and representation pandering.

One series to ruin them all!"
I hope we can all agree that this isn't LOTR cannon
modern tv is basically women and black people
Granted itâ€™s the teaser trailer but what is this show about? Itâ€™s just so generic looking and the cgi looks so cheap! Is it about the forging of the rings or random people doing random things in front of random green screens! Even the title of the show sounds very generic. Sorry Iâ€™m getting bored even writing this comment!
Why are there no Asians????
JÃ¡ estou pensando em assinar a Amazon Prime Video por causa dessa sÃ©rie Ã©pica.  Muito obrigado Amazon por trazer de volta um dos melhores filmes jÃ¡ feito no mundo cinematogrÃ¡fico.
like Peter Jackons movies?
I heard around 400 million dollars but I could be wrong.
The masterpiece belongs completely to Tolkien.
Â @ReekÂ  And Jackson.
"One by one, the free subscribers of VOD fell to the power of Amazon Prime, but there were some who resisted."

Amazon should rather create and ruin their own franchise.
"To the creators of this new series... ""I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history â€“ true or feignedâ€“ with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse applicability with allegory, but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author."" - J.R.R. Tolkien"

What is this wretched horror Amazon has wrought? I thought this series was supposed to be based on Tolkien's work. I can't find him anywhere in it.
"man, with +100K likes, this trailer shows how deep and amazing this show will be ğŸ˜Š glad so many like it"
just let lotr rest peacefully
There were 3m dislikes like a month ago. They seem do be removing dislikes.
"Aragorn, one of the wisest and most noble men, would not decapitate an emissary while under parley."
"Â @ReekÂ  You're right, but this isn't even NEAR equivalent. If you wanted this to represent the same level of change, then Aragorn would have had to been a Wizard in the movies instead of a warrior/king at all.

In other words, you're reaching, and it makes you look like a damned fool."
Is that on porpuse? This has 3 million dislikes
I would forge an alliance with Sauron himself against this...
In case anyone is wondering : 113k Likes vs 1.5m dislikes. :)
"Such beautiful photography. Lovely landscapes, starts off nicely enough. Okay soundtrack as well. 
That's it. 

How can 1 min hurt this much?"
Yeah hard pass
I'm cancelling my Amazon prime sub because of this crap!
The trailer is mostly people looking up....actors in a green room unconvincingly looking up at nothing.
You can remove all the dislikes and comments you want. You won't be winning anyone over.
"The only good news is that it isnt gonna make the originals look bad, the bad news is instead its just gonna be godawful."
"I'm all for inclusion, but NOT for modifying an established and loved fictional world. There were other races such as the Haradrim that could have been used instead of altering the established races. In fact, having folks from Harad would likely have made for some exciting storylines. By altering the world in the way you apparently have done, you've lost the faith of this fan. What were you thinking over at Prime?"
It's like Tolkien is so much of a troll that he preemtively wrote quotes for the annoying purist to not even have to come up with their own sentences..
amazon sucks
This is going to be a billion dollar flop.  When are these Hollywood hacks and corporations going to learn?
I don't like what I see here!ğŸ˜”ğŸ‘
DISLIKE!ğŸ‘
Amazon you are destroying Lord of the Rings!ğŸ™ğŸ‘
bullshit
Looks good! You guys are all nerds.
F
Garbage
"If Tolkein had seen this, we would to Tolkien his own life..."
"It's not the trailer. It's everything the creators have told us about this, which is a lot."
Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  like Peter Jacksons movies
"Â @ReekÂ  he stuck to the story super closely considering the adaptations he needed to make it into a film, but this show can't even stick to the thinnest skeleton. That alone shows their utter disregard for Tolkien's work."
Â @Lil FishÂ  Have you seen the show?
Â @ReekÂ  I have heard plenty from the creators own mouths to know I don't want to have to scrub my mind of hr memory of this abomination.
Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  So? Have you seen the show?
"Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  I think you will watch this, and then complain about it, and then next year watch the next season and complain more about it."
"Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  It's an ancient form of storytelling, far older and more civilized than load noise and images"
Yes.ğŸ‘
Yes
It was already destroyed by PJ
Â @ReekÂ  nope. Same spirit in both stories. This is just their world with Tolkien's name.
"Â @Lil FishÂ  The books are about overcoming evil and greed.
The movies are about fighting, battles and epicness."
"Â @ReekÂ  the movies are about overcoming evil and they are very deep. They took the gem of LOTR and they polished it, and condesed it and presented it in a way that was more than a film. It was an experience."
"Â @ReekÂ  There is a reason so many watch it in hard times, because it calls to something deep within and it somehow gives you strength. My mom asked to play the movie on loop when she was dying of cancer. . . And that was not because it was an action movie."
"Â @Lil FishÂ  The movies are fun and entertaining, and have more depth than most movies. But they have at most 5% of the depth the books have."
"Â @ReekÂ  I've always thought the movies were like a well polished jewel. Perhaps not perfect, but they took some of the most beautiful lines and poignant moment sand brought them to life in an exquisite way. They are a masterpiece."
"Â @Lil FishÂ  To be fair, I like the movies. They are great action movies and much more faithful than virtually all other adaptions. However, the tone of the movies is off. It too much focuses on the action (for teens, young adults and manbabies)."
"Â @ReekÂ  1. I'm a woman, not a man. 2. The tone was deep and soulful and many people watch it when times are hard in their lives for a reason. If you can't see the depth like others can, that does not reflect on the films, or us. It reflects on you."
"Â @Lil FishÂ  1. ok
2. Great. I can't judge you for loving the movies. If you think they have much depth, then that's fine. But they don't have the depth the books have and they are too action-oriented. If times are hard in my life, I watch quality tv like old South Park or The Simpsons."
Infested with cgi is not looking good
"No, that looks disastrous and has nothing to do with the Lord of the Rings world."
it looks like a fucking video game cutscene
Wtf so youâ€™re gonna release this on the same day Tolkien diedâ€¦
They don't need Ring to destroy Middle Earth   -_-
No respect for J.R.R Tolkien or the source material. Amazon and corporations need to stop hiring hack writers that will never hold a candle to the greatness of Tolkien or George Lucas. Just embarrasing.
I dislike this.
"imagine a 1000-year-old elf being a rebellious heroine
(idk what her actual age was during the time but Galadriel was pretty old)"
"So it's not enough for you to lose money on it, 
now you want to destroy our beloved franchises?"
"113k likes and 1,5 mill dislikes so far"
"Hey look another show I can mock and ridicule now that Batwoman is cancelled ğŸ˜ˆ

And hey, though this will definitely suck, at least we still have the OG films ğŸ˜‰"
"Well, they just wanted to connect people acros nations and races and they succeeded. everybody hates them..."
Disgraceful
Shouldnâ€™t have turned your back on the people that support your product lmao
Return YouTube Dislike extension: spread the word !!
ğŸ‘ğŸ¼
"Hard Pass, this looks shite and doesnt seem to be in the style of Tolkin."
"Imagine defecating on beloved franchises and burning hundreds of millions of dollars just because some loud teenagers on Twitter demanded diverse representation in media, even though they had no intention of ever watching the shows/films in the first place hahahaha"
"We will not support this, you make a mockery of our literature."
"1.6 million dislikes to 120k likes
For anyone who wants to know the ratio, as yt has blocked the general public from getting to know a bad video...lol"
"Oh well...
Another great series will be ruined..."
Wtf is this?
They are taking a timeless tale and are setting it in our contemporary zeitgeist. They are adding elements that are very 2022 to it that five years from now are gonna appear laughable. It's just wrong.
Tolkien was a great writer. George Lucas was not. Remember the prequels?
"Â @ReekÂ  Really mate, you need to stop. First Attacking Jackson all over, now Lucas? Maybe take some writing classes, or watch their films, think real hard and attempt to comprehend this. My goodness, you truly must be joking you cant be this off."
If you're referring to Galadriel she was 1500 years by the time Annatar arrived at Middle-Earth.
"it isn't ""connecting"" people if you take one people's art and subvert it"
ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
Â @Shrek Fan 1776Â  he mean they succeeded in united nations and races in hatred for their work
"I doubt they even knew the Books. I mean, who takes seriously spoiled teenagers in the first place?"
"You will watch it, and then you will wait for season 2 and watch that too."
"1.5 million dislikes jesus christ what did they do lol
not a LOTR guy so someone fill me in"
"I came back to check if my dislike was removed... It was, so I put it back."
"This looks more like a trailer for the ""Golden Compass"" movie"
For those who cant see it. Their is 90% dislike on this video
HAHAHAHAHHAAH! I just laugh on you Amazon! You pathetic egoist idiot.... :D
Youtube dislike google chrome extension! :)
"Im not a LOTR fan, I just casually liked the trilogy, so donâ€™t get me wrong when I ask this: Whats wrong with this show? Im not saying it looks great, but it doesnt look that awful, what is it exactly that people didnâ€™t like?"
People are already judging this... I think y'all are too much.
This looks like garbage!
I would actually prefer to get kidnapped by actual pirates than pirate this movie
"â€œWe made a promise to ourselves at the beginning of the process that we weren't going to put any of our own politics, our own messages or our own themes into these movies. What we were trying to do was to analyze what was important to Tolkien and to try to honor that. In a way, we were trying to make these films for him, not for ourselves.â€ - Peter Jackson"
"Likes and dislikes update:
113k likes
1,5mln dislikes

Never been so proud."
what the heck was that
Who asked for this?
WHY ....???
I aint going to even pirate this. Thats how bad it iz :)
Blasphemy! ğŸ˜
"Why, why, why couldnâ€™t they have let the story stand on its own the way that Peter Jackson did. Instead they had to introduce 2022 political correctness into middle earth which to me is like making a movie about the Dark ages and then giving them cruise missiles and M1 tanks to fight with. Amazon sucks so bad for this ruination of a brilliant authors lifeâ€™s work!"
"1 May 2022.  Current tally, is 1.5 Million dislikes."
"""But not this day!"" - Aragorn"
Lol they are destroying the story and main characters ...and this is a Reboot...
"Perhaps you would prefer that LOTR fans not care about the franchise?  Wait ...that makes no sense. The problem with ''let's just sit back and see what happens'' is then there will be five seasons of this crap.  The only thing that makes sense as fans is to voice our concerns as strongly as possible to give Amazon the chance to pull back on some of the excessive mistakes.  If all the fans just shrugged and said ''wait and see'', they would not be very good fans."
"Peter Jackson made Aragorn behead an emissary while under parley.
Even DISNEY didn't ignore the rules of parley in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies."
Bezos.
Â @Lil FishÂ  Couldnâ€™t have said it better myself
Same here. I'm going to enjoy watching the reactions and ridiculing of it immensely.
''the way that Peter Jackson did'''?
I billion dollar flop coming up.
What is thisshit?!
all the lord of the rings and the Hobbit  series malti audios Telugu dubbed  Amazon prime videos
Telugu dubbed
Worst Series ever
We need to give amazon a chance to prove that we are wrong .
Not too late to scrap this crap and start again. You're going to lose millions of dollars.
not a single positive comment here. can't wait to see the reactions when the show releases
horrible
"Evil labours with vast power and perpetual success - in vain: preparing always only the soil for unexpected good to sprout in.    ~  J. R. R. Tolkien

Don't let up.  Let Amazon know we will not accept their crap."
I'm not going to waste my time with this BS. How to ruin Tolkien's work.
"1.5 million dislikes for those who cant see
Also, if you plan on watching this show, i recommend using a free streaming website! Do not support amazon with your curiosity of viewing a train wreck"
Does Gandalf become a Birthing Person in this iteration (bastardization) of the IP?
No thankyou
dislike
this is going to SUCK!!!
My god it looks awful
"the horror or corporate meddling and how they attempt manipulate the masses continue, and the public are taking off their blindfolds slowly but surely: chipping away at the foundations to one day reach the core 
--""But as the theme progressed, it came into the heart of Melkor to interweave matters of his own imagining that were not in accord with the theme of Iluvatar; for he sought therein to increase the power and glory of the part assigned to himself."" - The Silmarillion - J.R.R Tolkien
i hope this backlash stings"
"Reminds me Sword of Shannara adaptation TV series which were made in Australia or NZ. Characters were wearing jeans. 

Here the budget is bigger but it also feels plasticy."
"Dislike (since the counter is gone)- Go on call me a racist/sexist you uninspired uncreative presumptuous bigots. Weâ€™ll both be thrown into the fires of Mordor. Iâ€™m ready, are you?"
We have. They decided to take our concerns and tell us to shove off calling us racists... Instead of addressing the real problems.
Â @Lil FishÂ  you again ğŸ˜„
"Â @Hina KaramatÂ  Lil Fish is absolutely right, the teaser trailer is their chance to prove that they can be faithful to the source material. But this 1 minute shows they aren't  and all of the articles surrounding showrunner comments show that we aren't wrong, they are just determined to continue in their folly"
Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  just don't lose hope please ğŸ¥º.
Â @Hina KaramatÂ  ğŸ˜ğŸ™ƒğŸ‘‹
"Â @Hina KaramatÂ  What do you mean don't lose hope? They literally tease Wizards and Hobbits despite neither of them being in middle earth during the time this was set. Im sorry but if you are writing a documentary on the Pelopannesian war and you have Winston Churchill as the Persian General, I'm not going to take you seriously"
Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â   lol why
Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  then what's the problem.
Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â   okay bye !
Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  okay but can i ask what name of the  elf on account photo .
Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â   is it sauron vampire form
Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â   i thought you was a fan of Tolkien.
Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â   okay nice good bye I am an elf sailing to valinor.
No ğŸ¤£
Â @AE3587Â  why am i to late that's why all ships are already sailed to valinor.
NOBODY ASKED FOR THIS. NOBODY WANTS IT.
Whatâ€™s the point of having source material if you completely bastardize what was originally there
They are going to murder Tolkien's work folks. This deserves to fail
Dislikes at 1.5 million. Nice
No
The next billion dollar turd
"Amazon has a new norm each week : keep the comments under 50,000, because all are negative. Each week, all comments that goes over 50,000 are deleted. I don't even want to think about what literary filth the dialogues made for young adults will sound between Nori, the sushi wrap and Theo, gender neutral nicknames. This happens when US snowflakes needs representation in European culture, because poor them don't have one. Here an advice for Amazon : if you want to take a literary book from Europe and adapt it, at least get the adaptation right, you see here we have culture, not pop culture and of course you will be laugh for stupidity.  

Take Christopher Tolkien advice and stop inserting your poor knowledge of other people culture in Tolkien work of literature : â€œTolkien has become a monster, devoured by his own popularity and absorbed by the absurdity of our time,â€ Christopher Tolkien observes sadly. â€œThe chasm between the beauty and seriousness of the work, and what it has become, has gone too far for me. Such commercialization has reduced the esthetic and philosophical impact of this creation to nothing. There is only one solution for me: turning my head away.â€ - Christopher Tolkien in Le Monde."
TRASH!
1.5 mil dislike
If Christopher Tolkien still alive... RIP.
and i was thinking to get Prime for this :D :D..... This torrent material at the best.
ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ»ğŸ‘ğŸ¼ğŸ‘ğŸ½ğŸ‘ğŸ¾ğŸ‘ğŸ¿
This money could have went to making The Wheel of Time better. Also follow the source. NO ONE WANTS YOUR INTERPRETATION.
Tolkiens works are like a beautiful statue that served as inspiration and drive for many other fantasy settings later created. This half baked cash grab wheel of time reskin is the equivalent of a pigeon crapping on that statue. Itâ€™s ultimately going to be washed away and forgotten but itâ€™s still irritating to see
this is a HARD PASS for me. prefer to see the originals again
looks cheap and expencive at the same time...
"So before the lord of the rings an the hobbit was a CRINGE, as i understand?"
"are we meant to be impressed at 0:22 with that BS ? she would not come to a sudden stop like that! anyway, first time watching this nonsense. disliked"
I'm not going to watch it.
i do not need an extra  dislike counter to tell  that when u have about 30 million views and only 113 thousand likes that thats bad.
No. If we all reject this the only things dieing will be Amazon Prime and wokeness in movie industry.
Let us be clear the only reason most people would want to watch this show is because of the Tolkien name and his legacy.  Amazon is trying to sell us this turd by wrapping it in an LOTR wrapper and slapping a Tolkien sticker on it.  This actually makes it worse than creating a bad series; it is disrespectful.  Create your own brand if you have talented people with a wonderful story to tell.
So this is why Youtube removed the dislike count?
"I don't know enough of LOTR to dislike the video out of accuracy, but apparently this has a lot of dislikes that i can't see and as such i feel the need to add to the amount of dislikes."

1.5M dislikes wow!
"Ya know, I'd never given any thought to what a crap sandwich would look like. Well, now I know..."
"Look forward to seeing this, let's hope it's enjoyable."
Gonna be honest it doesnt look that good
"ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ oh were gonna be clever and removed the count for dislikes. Lol all that does is encourage people to write their thoughts about how trash your ""product"" is. Which is far worse than a ratio. I know your marketing department is probably filled with barely literate people who don't understand actual human communication but some one who takes the time to write a comments does more to effect people's opinion of you dumpster fire film than all the glitzy marketing. Millions of dollars vs some dude with an opinion, guess what has a bigger impact to cost ratio..."
"Too much â€œrepresentationâ€ , pushing agendas, and just like anything Amazon /Disney touches will flop faster than rocks thrown into the sea."
At what number of dislikes is this video? 1.5m?
why have you deleted millions of dislikes?  - For those without the browser extension installed its currently 113K likes and 1.5M dislikes
29million views. Only 100k likes? You can remove the dislike button but you canâ€™t remove maths.
Looks way too polished. Same as the Hobbit movies. Lotr was rough around the edges in all the right ways that made Jacksons world look real.
"What happen actually, why is everyone disliking this? I don't understand."
Looks like it has potential. Weird so many people feel so strongly against it before seeing it. All this talk of defending a dead person that none of you know for sure what he'd think anyway.
1.5 million dislikes
"Another HALO nice seeing hollywood is actually united in producing trash. my courage will not fail, I will not forasek my friends and I will not break my bond of fellowship. to the prime video person deleting comments thats from the move the third one from the trilogy since you guys arent bothering to read the books. t"

They need Tolkien's name attached to this."

As long as you don't watch it with the intent of it having anything to do with Middle Earth and if you like generic fantasy you'll probably get on OK with it
"at this point 1,6"
"Â @peloquinfulÂ  thank you, i dont have the addon for android."
"They have changed the story and main characters. It's not middle earth...and this is the appetizer for their plans for middle earth. Thy have been incredibly disrespectful and dishonorable as well in so many ways, both to Tolkien and the fans. They want to retell everything even what's already been made into film with their ""message."""
"Â @Lil FishÂ  But how? I mean if you search for wiki, they still have the characters and settings remain."
"Â @Starry NightÂ  they are the characters in name only. They totally changed their personalities, i.e. galadriel and elrond... they will be pathetic based on amzon's descriptions....their roles and their storylines. They are trying to compress thousands of years Into a tiny timeline...and they are getting rid of essential characters, because they don't have intellectual rights to the time period they are representing."
"Â @Lil FishÂ  Actually, how did you guys know? I wish to know the source btw. That will be outrageous if it is true"
"Â @Starry NightÂ  there are a bunch of articles where they tell us what they want to do...ands lot of channels covering it. They fired their Tolkien scholar after they knew Tolkien's grown sun (spelling intentional) ğŸ’€, then ramped up their production."
Letter 210 buddy. Letter 210.
"Â @Mister WabbitÂ  Thanks, I understand now."
We all know it is trash.
"Its not just ""defending a dead person"" its wanting to see the father of modern mythology's ideas and ideals remain unmolested, as he himself desired of the Brother's Grimm."
"Sure, has nothing to do with defending English cultural art and heritage or anything like that... There is also plenty of material other then the trailer which makes this whole thing concerning at least a dawn travesty at worse."
Â @DelogrosÂ  This guy gets it
There is no way that has been done manually.
"Â @bighand69Â  for the most part no, but some have......."
"I was Looking forward to this LOTR's TV series but from what I have seen and heard it frankly looks terrible Now I am not saying that the Silmarillion should be treat like the Bible but to change it to such a degree?.. It seems to me they have taken the LOTR name and a few characters wrote their own Story and used the Tolkien brand Name to sell a second rate fantasy series. There is and you can say what you like one thing The Silmarillion is just that and anything Else just isn't.
Think of it this way if younger people are introduced to the whole LOTR world thru this TV series and lets say they grow to love the thing well fine ok good. But then they pick the actual book I reckon they will be either Bewildered disappointed or completely disinterested in the actual reading Matter simply put they are going to expect a story about an Elven Warrior Princess called Galadriel and they are not going to find that. Thus to a generation the LOTR and the Silmarillion isn't a Timeless piece of literature but an Expensively cheap copy made by Jeff f--king Bezos 
Finally What's next are we going to see the same bullshit shoe horned into Shakespeare.. And I know Peter Jackson didn't stick Exactly the Tolkien Books because if he had it would have been an Octology of three hour movies well there you go my thoughts on something I am now not likely to see But for those that do you can be rest assured that at least it will be Stunning and Brave if precious my precious gollum gollum.... little to do with The LORD OF THE RINGS  Titularillion I think it should be better suited to this. 
here is my appendix 1
I remember myself after reading the Hobbit the LOTRs and all the appendices I was craving for more and the Silmarillion was the Answer but it takes a lot more attention than the other two as it's the basics upon which Middle earth is based and that well to me is important this isn't Game of Thrones where nudity and murder and viewership seemed the driving factor. Anyway sorry not sorry to make quite the meal of it.... I shan't add anymore 
NamÃ¡riÃ«
Ah! like gold fall the leaves in the wind,
long years numberless as the wings of trees!
The years have passed like swift draughts
of the sweet mead in lofty halls beyond the West,
beneath the blue vaults of Varda
wherein the stars tremble in the song of her voice, holy and queenly.
Who now shall refill the cup for me?
For now the Kindler, Varda, the Queen of the Stars,
from Mount Everwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds,
and all paths are drowned deep in shadow;
and out of a grey country darkness
lies on the foaming waves between us,
and mist covers the jewels of Calacirya for ever.
Now lost, lost to those from the East is Valimar!
Farewell! Maybe thou shalt find Valimar.
Maybe even thou shalt find it. Farewell!"
Oh amazon what did you do...
I love how people of every race and gender is united against this garbage
lol they are mass deleting comments ğŸ¤£
This gonna be awful
Use me a dislike button
"For those who don't see the dislike bar, just install the extension."
this makes me so angry
Yeah so 113K/1.5M is an utterly heinous ratio the worst I've seen but hopefully they can pull their heads out of each others asses and salvage Tolkien's legacy before it's too late!
Wow they destroyed a good story
What you can see on this trailer? NOTHING
"""I wish it need not have happened in my time""
""So do all who live to see such things""

The Rings of Weakness
"â€œThere is no curse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of Men for this treachery.â€ â€• J.R.R. Tolkien"
"I am asian and i dont think the story or world of lord of the rings needs to be more diverse. If amazon wanted to do this, they could have just invented their own fantasy world because this has no resemblance to middle earth"
Trash
This is horseshit.
I get it that you want to make money out of this... and not being strict to lore and upsetting fans is gonna reduce that money! SO FOR WEALTHS SAKE LISTEN TO THE FANS STICK TO THE LORE! AND YOU MIGHT MAKE MORE MONEY THAN ALL THE CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD!! I MEAN YOU NEED TO HIRE A PERSON WHO HAS COMMON SENSE TO TELL YOU THIS!!!
That CGI is ROUGH
"Vade retro, demon!"
1.5 million lmaoo
Â @npuÂ  exactly
Amazon could have done amazing job creating their own show for $200 million.
"1.5 million dislikes, 113k likes. Amazon you should be ashamed of yourself for disrespecting Tolkien's work. Did you know that Amazon will release this monstrosity on the same day that Tolkien died, on September 2nd? They literally want to commemorate the destruction of his work."
It's obvious from the scenes with Galadriel in the teaser that this is not an adaptation. Why don't the elves have long hair? Why is it so CGI-Clean like the Wheel the Time? $1 billion really?
"Tom Shippey was disregarded and tossed aside like he's nothing, and I want to know why. I'll bet it's because he stood up for what was RIGHT until the very end!"
This show is getting fucked on lmaoo
can anybody make a  comment and type ''dislike'' and we can upvote it as a real dislikebutton solved problem
I check in on this video every few weeks just to make sure my dislike is still there
"If someone would like to know:

"A day may come when the courage of men fails,

when we forsake our friends

and break all bonds of fellowship,

This day we fight!!

By all that you hold dear on this good Earth,

I bid you stand, Men of the West!!!"
"As this comment written, the dislike is 1.5m"
More like the Rings of Failure
It is a lovely pile of trash!
"Tolkien's writings isn't for a ""modern"" audience. 
That's why it's good. And your writing is trash."
"This could have been an acceptable Dungeons and Dragons series what with all the home-brewed lore and rules. Why try to outdo Tolkein? You know what amazon should to next, an adaptation of Brothers Karamasov but they are all adopted from around the world and it should be set in modern times."
"Just in case someone doesn't have the extension, current like/dislike ratio as of 04/30/22 is 113K/1.5M"
you guys effed up

"Great job amazon destroying a great masterpiece like tolkien's stories, I'm not watching this rings of power crap, yes because this isn't lord of the rings!!!."
113k likes to 1.5M dislikes
Im tired of prequels. Thats what the Hobbit was. It was good. But why do we need ANOTHER prequel
People have  tried. Gets lost in thr comment section.
"install the extension man, it's at a 110k:1.5 million like dislike ratio"
"It is timeless, not trendy."
"They could have made their own show for a fraction of the money they put into this. They could have made three fantasy shows for that money. Such as a Game of Throne adult show, family fantasy show and their own diversity show.  And they would have done far better out of that."
So?
Â @ReekÂ  now people without the addon know. that is so
Why lol
Seems to me anything else but Tolkien's Work. Fail!
1.5M dislikes! XD
LOL amazon u fucked up so hard
1.5 million dislikes and growing daily.  Tolkien will be so sad the day this is released.
Garbage
If only you could see the dislikes.
"Just an update: I'm using YouTube Vanced and can see the dislikes.

Currently, we're sitting at 113K likes, and 1.5M dislikes"
"In my mind star wars 7,8 and 9 dont exist, and neither will this."

"Too bad. Such good material to work with, and this looks like garbage."
Can't wait for this show
current like / dislike count is 113k (likes)  1.5M (Dislikes) there is an addon on chrome that can restore dislikes being visable. and holy fucking ratio batman this is a doozey
"One word. Trash. Dislikes are easily well over 2 million. Those using ""certain"" plugins will see it is above 1.5 million in dislikes. This is beyond repugnant."
"There is no comparison to make here, books and live action are 2 different things even tho we speak about the ''same'' story. I think no one, will ever be so close to create live action middle-earth themed content than Peter Jackson ( i guess in this case we'll see Beleriand too?). Although i've read all Tolkien books about this world and even tho i understand that this might be a flop, i'm always here to watch anything related to the story that is filmed in New Zealand. I see why people don't trust this, but after all, everything we see in cinemas, must be inspired by something from the past, sci-fi or not. So please don't talk about real fans or not (also the word ''fans'' should not be refered for any Tolkien reader). Except from  books some people really like cinema and live action more than reading books (i prefer books equal to movies). There is no competition who knows better or judge better, u can easily choose what to see and read by yourself. I also understand the need people have to ''protect'' Tolkien's work but this is not one of his works, it's just a series inspired by the books. A writer and a director have many things in common , yet their work is completely different. No one could ever bring this to perfect live action apart Tolkien himself. (This is equal to any other book story that is brought to live action, from my point of view).
P.S. Mind that there are more important things to care about while judging directors, filmakers and even actors...stop being so ''i know everything about this, i listen to no one''. Try to enjoy the series and if not just don't watch it :^).
P.S. I don't want to be misunderstood, i really wish someone else would direct the series to be accurate, but after all, that's all we have right? :p."
Here have another dislike
"One thing I've not seen mentioned here is how the music carries none of the lotr soul that howard shore brought to it. Its generic fantasy music and forgettable. None of the mystical beauty of the elves, the stoic pride of rohan, the peace and tranquility of hobbits, the dutiful resolve of gondor, I could go on. It would be like Star Wars without John Williams. The whole aesthetic visually and musically doesn't feel like its got any true lotr soul in it."
"â€œThe canons of narrative in any medium cannot be wholly different; and the failure of poor films is often precisely in exaggeration, and in the intrusion of unwarranted matter owing to not perceiving where the core of the original lies.â€  - J.R.R. Tolkien"
he would be sad seeing PJ's LotR trilogy too
"Â @ReekÂ  PJ'S trilogy is at least held in Tolkien's universe. Some of us are not purists, that doesn't mean we have 0 standards."
"Â @Adrian GarciaÂ  this show doesn't have changes, it's a completely different story with 0 respect for the source material. Not everyone is a purist, but there is such a thing as Respect. The only racists here are people who can only feel like a human represents them if they have the same color skin."
"Â @ReekÂ  
The PJ LotR would not have been liked by him but this new show would have made him go into a fit."
"Rogue One was good and I recognise that but not 8,9 and god knows what comes next."
Peter Jackson beat Amazon to it
"Â @ReekÂ  funny, because when I watch thr films and read the book, sma changes aside, it's tr same story with thr same spirit. This show couldn't even stick to thr most basic of outlines. Talk about hubris."
Same! TRASH FIRE!!!! ğŸ¿ ğŸ¿ ğŸ¿ğŸ¤£
...to flop
Â @ĞĞ½Ğ´Ñ€ĞµĞ¹ ĞĞ·Ğ´Ñ‹Ğ¼Ğ°Ñ…Ğ°Â  impossible
Â @Fahad Akhtar ChandioÂ  It already did
"@Andrew Kanellopoulos
Stop making excuses. They have decided that being diverse is more important. That is there free choice but it is also the free choice of those that decide to watch it or pass on it."
"It's like a cardbord, microwavable freezer pizza with nothing on it."
Â @L NAPHÂ  Its like ordering a pie to find it has no filling
Â @Godric LorandianÂ  and the crust is dry.
"Yall know that Shore is going to do the music for this show as well, right?"
"Â @Adrian GarciaÂ  I hadn't heard that, but what they presented here for music was still way off course. At least they havent taken pride in how they know nothing about the source material like the halo show, but I'm not confident they are going to respect the works of tolkien, and unfortunately his son is no longer around to defend his father's legacy"
Â @Godric LorandianÂ  they have shown utter contempt for his work in so many ways. It's really sad.
"Â @L NAPHÂ  Dang, I haven't been super up to date on this show's production. But I know they really showed their colors a lot after Christopher Tolkien passed. I wish these show producers would respect the source material of authors and the legacies they have. Tolkien's legacy is massive and I dont think this show will be able to destroy that, the reception here shows that there is still great reverence for Tolkien's work and its awesome to see how much love people have for his work still. Lotr is truly timeless."
"Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  I know,  that's what I said that the show itself is going to be composed by Shore."
"After a lifetime of searching, I finally found a unicorn! And I'm not being metaphorical. I tracked, trapped, tamed, and now proudly gallop through the ancient forest on a magical white horse with a spiraling ivory horn protruding from the crest of its head.

Still haven't found a positive comment on this video. ğŸ¤ª"
"Youtube Dammit, stop removing comments ğŸ˜¤."
What even is this supposed to beâ€¦.. Iâ€™ve read most of Tolkienâ€™s works and this doesnâ€™t remind me of any of the ones Iâ€™ve read?
One point 5 million downvotes and they think this is a go at Amazon. LOL
"Frodo : I canâ€™t do this, Sam.

Sam: I know. Itâ€™s all wrong. By rights we shouldnâ€™t even be here. But we are. Itâ€™s like in the great stories Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didnâ€™t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy. How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened. But in the end, itâ€™s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didnâ€™t. Because they were holding on to something.



Frodo : What are we holding on to, Sam?



Sam : That thereâ€™s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And itâ€™s worth fighting for.

Let's fight against this evil called Amazon and its ""political correctness"", for the legacy that is Tolkien. 
It is truly a crime what they are trying to do to Tolkien's work."
This will surely suck and will be a fail

I am afraid they gonna ruin LOTR legacy even more than they did with Hobbit
So its basically elden ring
"i hope there is no some kind of LGBTHQ++++++ SCENES, i want just a pure LOTR Series like Fellowship, Two Towers, and Return of The king"
"Tolkien was publicly against allegory, yet here we are with Amazon doing exactly that."

"They just had to make everyone young and a minority....Which I wouldn't mind....IF THEY DIDNT EMPHASIZE it so much and just made a good trailer. This couldve been anything....Lion witch and wardrobe 5 for all we know...WHy did they get people who think tolken is ""problematic"" to create this show? (doesn't hollywood realize that most of us are on the side of inclusion and fixing all the problems they describe) its THE way they DO it making a point of the change....Just make a good movie/show and you can convey those same LESSONS in a non preachy way...best example i can think of is instead of  showing the characters in the trailer you want represented doing NOTHING  Actually have the minority characters you want represented DOING something......not just standing there BEING whatever they are. (or just dont make a shitty boring trailer WITH just showing faces....)"
You are graverobbers. That's all this is.
1.5 million dislikes .... ouch!
Reading his work is what sets you apart from the makers of this show.
"Don't worry, Amazon's show will destroy itself just fine."
"Â @L NAPHÂ  no harm in helping it along into the mass grave already setup starting with The Flash, Arrow, Superwahman, Batwahman, and Female Ghostbusters. ;)"
The Hobbit made mistakes this is an entire whole new thing that is not a mistake but something entirely different.
Â @bighand69Â  My problem is not the mistakes but the quality of the show
Amazon is obligated to Include that element in all their new shows.

"Man this is some bullshit.
I can believe Amazon would destroy the LOTR lore like that.
How have the Tolkien family estate not sued the crap out of Amazon for destroying J.RR Tolkiens work.
Insult to Tolkien and a spit in the face for fans."

My dislike was removed. So I did it again. Any way. This comment section is beyond brilliant. Just love it. Thanks to this abomination people got united strong in Tolkien spirit.
"I'm going to do my mind a favour and read the books instead. I might have given it a chance, but the insidious marketing campaign has really turned me off."
Wow most expensive series yet and it doesnt even gave me lotr vibesğŸ˜•. Such a missed chance.
Removing dislikes and comments. Pretty cringe.

"This show is going to suck.

I prefer to read the books again
Â @Adolfthejewbaka _Â easier but not the only way. I could identify with a black homosexual female if she was going through the same troubles I went through in my life.
Â @EgyptiangoodgamerÂ  Well the point of story telling is to identify as closely with its audience and the audience of LOTR is straight white European men. Thatâ€™s who itâ€™s made for abs thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that
"Â @Adolfthejewbaka _Â  You mean a movie isn't made for black gay guys unless there's at least one black gay guy in it? That's the mentality that ruins everything these days. Slumdogs Millionaire comes to mind, I'm a european white boy and still feel it was made for me, since it was made for those who likes good movies.

The bloody setting of a movie does not specify who it's made for. Just try to be more open minded."
Â @Adolfthejewbaka _Â  He  mean that audience of lotr is normal
Â @Tuomas HuuhtanenÂ  Of course you can enjoy the movie however itâ€™s undeniable more difficult to relate to characters that donâ€™t look like you or act like you. And LOTR is made for white European men thatâ€™s a fact
"Â @Adolfthejewbaka _Â  I'm not ""white"" and I'm definitely no man, but in the friendship, loyalty and courage of the characters I find all the representation I need."
"Â @Adolfthejewbaka _Â  It's not undeniably more difficult to relate to characters that don't look or act like you, if your empathy only functions normally. I had no difficulties relating to characters of Mel Gibsons Apocalypto, none. I had no difficulties to relate to characters of Squid Game either. It just sound like you have issues in your cabability to feel empathy. Do you feel nothing when you see civilian war victims, if they don't look exactly like you? I mean come on! You have a problem, not us."
Â @Tuomas HuuhtanenÂ  Deny reality all you want Iâ€™m not gonna stop you my friend. Answer this for me would you look after your neighbours kids first or your own?
Â @Anywn OakenshieldÂ  I donâ€™t care what you are the point is make content for your audience and Tolkien isnâ€™t for you itâ€™s for white European men always has been
Â @Anywn OakenshieldÂ  You canâ€™t refute that fact though can you. His entire saga is rooted in a deep mythology of Northern European history specifically Anglo Saxon English identity. You arenâ€™t white therefore itâ€™s not meant for you. You can enjoy and appreciate it however stop sticking your noses on
"You can't judge a show before seeing it. It might suck, but we can't know for sure now."
Youâ€™re fine with diverse casting? So youâ€™re fine with the destruction of Tolkienâ€™s work? Ethnic revisionism is cancer
Â @Adolfthejewbaka _Â  I don't care about diverse casting. I care about the story and characters and the feeling of the show.
"Â @Adolfthejewbaka _Â  Iâ€™m fine if there was like a single diverse role where you could make a back story make sense about it, not this trash were there is entire races of black hobbits and shlt with no explanation. This is before The Fellowship so whatâ€™s the explanation thereâ€™s no black people in the original trilogy ?"
what about PJ's lotr trilogy?
"Â @ReekÂ  Peter Jackson's work differs in many ways from the book, although these are differences that do not alter the structure of the book's original in a caric-like manner. I believe that Tolkien himself would not complain about the arrival of elves in Helm's deep or the fact that the Ghost army from Dunharrow appears under minas tirith. Tolkien himself said it would be difficult to make a movie.

for this reason, the hobbit (movie) is a tragedy, although I think it is still worth watching"
The Peter Jackson trilogy is good because the respected the author's original intent. The hobbit it trash.
You like the look of cgi?
This is where I come to cry

"It is because they are ignoring the lore of Lord of The Rings to create this. Yes part of the problem is putting in black Dwarves makes no sense lore wise and the fact that they did not even put a beard on her was showing how little the care about Tolkien's world. It was lazy of the writers because there are black races in Tolkien's world the could have written about but they chose to ignore that for the easy way out. They have also changed big characters into something they have not like Galadriel. There is more however people trying to make this a race issue are just obscuring the real issue that they keep ""updating"" these books with enormous fan base to make someone that never read the books happy. The problem is that nobody wants it updated that truly loves the books. 

The Lord of The Rings moves made by Peter Jackson are the example of what you do, you keep as close to the books as possible. You honor the writer by changing as little as possible. Those three movies are timeless, 30 years from now you will watch them and they will not reflect when they were made and you will love them."
"Â @TheOtherGuyÂ  Peter Jackson also ignored the lore of Lord of the Rings in favour of action and spectacle. Rings of Power hasn't aired yet. There is a good possibility it will suck, but I can't judge now. And I don't care about the skin colour of the actors; I just want a good story with good characters."
Com Certeza !!!
"The new Brasil trailer, ""O Senhor dos AnÃ©is: Os AnÃ©is de Poder,""  in few hours afte releaase got ratio also, you pay so much money for telenovela actors to act in that promotion video and hit another defeat from fan base.

"Without some sort of realism in a fantasy world it becomes bland. The lore is lost and I won't be able to sit for 2+ hours to watch it. Since around 2019 not a single film has really captured my imagination, feminism has infected every movie.
In reality the majority of the fans don't care about feminism they just wanna watch a good movie, but even though feminists are few in numbers they are very loud and are supported by the media.
This is the movie dark age and we will never see an authentic story again, unless feminists are defeated."

Â @Lil FishÂ  i know I'm just kidding dear friend but seriously the thing is  we don't know people are doing wrong or right we can't decide but we can decide what is wrong or right for us . And i hope these words don't hurt you my precious ğŸ˜‚
"Â @Hina KaramatÂ  it's never right to betray an agreement in bad faith. It is also never right to take someone's lifework and try to tear it down against their wishes. These two things amazon is done, making themselves like Sauron the deciever."
Â @Lil FishÂ  may be your right but what are you talking about tearing lifeworks.
"Â @Hina KaramatÂ  Tolkien poured most of his life into his baby, this world with great love and detail. He had express written wishes for his work to be respected when adapted to film in such a way that amazon has egregiously breached... Willfully breached."
Â @Lil FishÂ  your sorry ğŸ˜” and thanks.
"Â @Hina KaramatÂ  Tolkien concerning a film adaptation: ""But I would ask them to make an effort of imagination sufficient to understand the irritation (and on occasion the resentment) of an author, who finds, increasingly as he proceeds, his work treated as it would seem carelessly in general, in places recklessly, and with no evident signs of any appreciation of what it is all about.â€

Next, Tolkien makes it very clear that canon should be respected no matter what the medium is, â€œThe canons of narrative in any medium cannot be wholly different; and the failure of poor
films is often precisely in exaggeration, and in the intrusion of unwarranted matter owing to not perceiving where the core of the original lies.â€"

Looks like something Amber Heard would do on Johnny Depps bed!
Just call it something else.
SHAME
Respect for Tolkien
"200 million dollars for this??
It looks like crap, why is everyone a child?? Why is Galadriel wearing a turban ?? Wtf have they even read the books??"
As of right now 113K likes and 1.5 million dislikes.
Just cancelled my amazon prime subscription.  I do not support companies that delete comments and treat fans like crap.
why though ?
"Hey, Amazon, from Brazil, more one coment to be deleted. We don't give up to protect Tolkien's legacy."
nope to this TRASH
This trailer looks so much better with this color grading. watch?v=T3yt6qkCKQU
"reasons to boycott Amazon:
1: working conditions of their employees
2: union busting
3. THIS
4. trying to censor this comment TWICE."
"Essa quantidade de likes e deslikes Ã© vergonhoso e ficar apagando sÃ³ torna mais patetico, sera que jÃ¡ nÃ£o teve exemplo o suficiente no mundo do entreterimento que nÃ£o respeitar o criador e a obra original sempre vai dar em desastre?, gostando ou nÃ£o sÃ£o os fans fieis que movem esse mercado e se os fans nÃ£o gostarem sempre sera um fracasso, ainda mais essa abominaÃ§Ã£o que jÃ¡ esta sendo linxada meses antes de lanÃ§ar, acho que nunca houve uma produÃ§Ã£o que foi tÃ£o atacada e odiada pelos fans quanto essa e com sorte no futuro pode ser que ocorra uma adaptaÃ§Ã£o fiel e respeitosa da grande obra de J.R.R Tolkien, por agora sÃ³ podemos continuar a batalha mostrando que esse tipo de desrespeito nÃ£o sera tolerado e esperar por dias melhores.


This amount of likes and dislikes is embarrassing and deleting it just makes it more pathetic, maybe there wasn't enough example in the entertainment world that not respecting the creator and the original work will always end in disaster?, whether the fans like it or not faithful that move this market and if the fans don't like it will always be a failure, even more this abomination that is already being sanded months before launching, I don't think there has ever been a production that was as attacked and hated by the fans as this one and with luck in the In the future there may be a faithful and respectful adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's great work, for now we can only continue the battle by showing that this kind of disrespect will not be tolerated and wait for better days."

Not a fan of what I'm seeing.

"100k of those are Amazon bots.
Roughly 13k are just brain damaged and were probably still trying to click dislike but misclicked"
It used to have over 4 million dislikes

I will not watch this. I will however watch youtubers tare it apart.
"This isn't Lord of the Rings. I'm all for a little creative adaptation in storytelling, but like Chuck Dixon said, what they're doing to Tolkien's work ""is an abomination."""

Very bad ......
Show us a dislikes!! Cenzors
YOU SHALL NOT.. PAAAAAAASS!!!
"Looks like this is one fandom to many being antagonized over ""modernizing"" a classic. The global pushback makes me very happy, as does the dislike ratio..."
Dislike. You still have time to cancel this show.
"Personally, I've always been more of a Star Wars fan. We all saw what happened with that mess in the last few years. I really appreciate Lord of the Rings, I hope your fandom can stand united. I'm with you."
"For over two months now I've been checking on this video and I am very proud of you, my friends :) Keep up the good work. And obviously I am talking to faithful Tolkien fans. Soon Jeff Bezos will learn what Bane of Isildur is."

Shut up and give my money back
"When you look at the direction that these people chose to go in, remember: a simple young Aragorn series was once the plan. Jesus fucking Christ."

Star Wars borrowed so many themes and plot points from Lord of the Rings
"You are a worthy ally. May the force be with you, my Lord Brady."
"i am an equal star wars and lotr fan but this trialer does not remind me of lotr in any way. also the trialer has 1,5 million dislikes lmao"
Â @The Boulder takes issue with that commentÂ  Star Wars borrowed from a tone of other properties of different genres including Tolkien. Even Marvel comics with Dr Doom and Darth Vader.
"Â @Galan AKA GalactusÂ  Yeah, Dune was a another big one he took at lot of inspiration from"
Where was the star wars fandom when the westfold fell?
"Â @The Boulder takes issue with that commentÂ  No, Star wars borrowed from dune not lotr, get it right next time"
Same here. It's heartening to see everyone band together to fight this evil.
"Same! I keep checking in every couple days, and it really warms my heart to see everyone speaking out against this. For Tolkien!"
1.6 million dislikes so far
Â @The Great Dear Leader Jim PickensÂ  Excellent.
I would love to watch that instead.
I will bet they changed that plan after they knew the sun (misspelling intended) of tolkien was no longer with us.

How many dislikes now?

You know what we should do? On the day this absolute dumpsterfire gets released we should all at once drop our Amazon Prime subscriptions. Send a message to Bezos he'll actually notice.
"Oh boy I can't wait for Thing I Like But Completely Different, Reimagined By People Nothing Like the Guy Who made the Thing I Like!"

You may censor these comments, but the Tolkien fans will bind these quotes on this story to drag them into deficit like the Chains of Aule around Melkor. Your Serie will enter the empty realm like Melkor himself, forever lost for good."
"Jesus guys, you've done goofed."

Â @Vinnicius ThiagoÂ  Why racists?
Â @AE3587Â  You just have to read a few comments and you'll find out why
Â @Vinnicius ThiagoÂ  People are not upset by the skin color ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ See? You have no clue what you are talking about
"Â @Vinnicius ThiagoÂ  You dont know anything about tolkien or middle earth, dont pretend to be a fan when you are a superfan"
"Â @AE3587Â  Yes, they are.

A tiny bit are worried about the look and feel of the world, but 99% are mad because there is a black elf."
Â @AE3587Â  I read all the books and seen all the movies. You know nothing about me.
"Â @Vinnicius ThiagoÂ  Nope that is not why people are upset. Blacl people are also fans of lotr, and they are equally upset like everyone else. Are they being racist too?"
"Â @Vinnicius ThiagoÂ  Let me take a guess. You have no clue why people are upset (wich is obvious) and instead of trying to understand you decided to guess, and you beloeved that your guess was the truth just loke a religious fanatic. Did i get that right?"
Â @Vinnicius ThiagoÂ  Sure you did. If you did you would have understood what the problem is and why people are upset about it. Instead you did the same thing as amazon and started calling people racist
Â @AE3587Â  Yes.
Â @Vinnicius ThiagoÂ  Ok then next time please try and understand
I already cancelled mine. Recommend i subscribe again and wait until it releases?
"The great public is the one that matters for the streaming service.

You're part of a Fandom. You don't matter"
"Â @Vinnicius ThiagoÂ  ""Fans don't matter, just the money"" Vinicus & Amazon, probably"
"Â @Vinnicius ThiagoÂ  Actually that's not strictly true, the entire point of buying the name was to increase Amazon subscriptions, that is what Amazon themselves have said the intent being Amazons own version of Game of thrones.
GoT was successful because it was relatively true to the source material and the fandom went out and convinced people who didn't want to read it that the show was good and word spread from there, for LoTR the films already exists with multi millions of fans so you've already had that process which means there is a real possability if they get this as wrong as it looks like they have they will net gain remarkably few subscriptions.

You're right only really in one way, Amazon is a big enough company that they could waste multiple Billions of dollars and not overly care as long as they also don't care about its reputation and in that regard the fandom doesn't matter all that much, still commercially failing at the most famous fantasy franchise after HBO's GoT would be fairly embarrassing."
"Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  but that's it. It's business. If more normal people like it, screw the Fandom"
"Â @Vinnicius ThiagoÂ  It looks like this is going to be yet another generic garbage aimed to the lowest common denominator. Having Tolkien's name attached to this may not be enough in a competition against other similarly assembly lined garbage. For the Witcher it works, because the brand is trendy right now, and it became trendy because it was built on quality other people did before the series got even hacked together. Tolkien is a big name, but not trendy popular culture phenomenon at the present moment, and if they fail to deliver quality, there is a decent chance that this show may fail, big."
Â @Land StriderÂ  nah you're good Strider. There are other ways for us to band together when this thing comes out.
Â @Vinnicius ThiagoÂ  Most people who like fantasy like lord of the rings... And will see this as a cheap knock off. It will be a joke. Amazon is screwed.
"Â @Tuomas HuuhtanenÂ  chances are that it'll be decent. But even if it was a 10/10, it wouldn't be enough. The fans already decided that they're not gonna like it."
"Â @Lil FishÂ  I like fantasy and like LOTR, I'm just not a racist fan."
"Â @Vinnicius ThiagoÂ   You are an activist, not a regular person who likes fantasy. You don't care for LOTR much, because you don't care if the essence of the work is upheld."
"Â @Vinnicius ThiagoÂ  also, based on the people in charge I can guarantee it will be no better than the work of the guy who trained them who ruined the new Disney star wars."
"Â @Lil FishÂ  I'm very far from being an activist. I just have common sense. ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚

I'm just not a sick fan.

And from what I can see, the essence is still there. Changing a person's skin tone changes nothing in the storytelling value."
"Â @Vinnicius ThiagoÂ  if you think skin tone is the issue, then you need to do more research before you enter the conversation."
Â @Vinnicius ThiagoÂ  but I think you know it isn't and are using it as your strawman. Come back when you have a real argument.
Bro is literally destroying the show with the source material

"As far as I understand it, Amazon wasn't allowed to use the Silmarilion as a source."
"The head writers, the fraud bros, came directly from JJ Abrams's cycles. Of course they did. And this show is on its way of becoming a failure so massive you can't possibly achieve without taking Kurtzman's advises, so no doubt he's involved somehow."
"You created a Fellowship, Prime Video.

This is so bad.
Ever since this comment section opened I had no need to buy salt ever again

For the NPCs
"As a girl who is also an avid fan of Tolkien, this is the most insulted I've been about any Tolkien adaptation, and I've hated The Hobbit trilogy with a passion, so that is saying something."
Great description.
they had no content on lotr go check
That is an incorrect number..They keep removing dislikes. I have had to re-add mine 4 times.
I'd love to see an exact dislike number each day. ğŸ™
ğŸ¯
Amen
They don't have the rights to the books.
"Â @Vinnicius ThiagoÂ  it's about the spirit of the work, not the content. Their behavior runs antithetical to the very core and workings of justice and goodness in middle earth. They are a part of the very 
Machine tollkien made as the forces of evil in his books. 

 Their idea that this will be a game of thrones and be lord of the rings at thr same time is problematic. Game of thrones was about a chess game of manipulation and force.  Tolkien exprrsssed it was not great power that changes the world, but small acts of kindness by everyday, small folk.  

Their forceful behavior is in line with thr darkness every time it manifests itself in middle earth, and they use their great power forcefully. We the little people stand with our fools hope against great darkness no matter the cost. Their behavior has triggered this very response at the core of every lover of middle earth."
The only thing they destroyed is themselves. Tolkien legacy comes from his books and is in fact impeccable. It will withstand whatever the storm is and keep attracting new generations of fans. While Amazon Prime will be just a footnote of history.
one of the best comments :))

Eww doesn't even seem like the majestic Lord of the Rings by Tolkien. Wtf is this.
The Age of Good Movies and Films is ending...
Â @Tim ElÂ  Not true at all.  There's plenty of great movies out there.  When I go see them the theaters are empty.  People only pay to see trash.  That's the problem.  Unless it's the latest marvel move people aren't interested.  Movie companies are only going to make films that make money.  That's business 101.
"Â @Hendo CalrissianÂ  yeah that's true, last night I saw The Northman and there was almost nobody there instead people would rather see some other stupid cotten candy blockbuster."
Â @Adrian HebertÂ  I literally just got back from Northman! Amazing. But yeah. There was like 6 people in the screen with me. It won't really encourage movie companies to make more films like it. Meanwhile they were showing Sonic 2 on two screens and loads were there to see it. ğŸ™„
"Â @Tim ElÂ  Check out ""Dune"" if you have not seen it already, prob the best movie in the last 10-15 years."
Â @Hendo CalrissianÂ  Hence why the age of good movies is ending....now days it just the same generic formula repeated again and again.
The Tolkien fans are not a group to be so easily outdone or messed up with! And Amazon is learning this lesson very hard right now. Brings me joy to see!
"Â @TwoCan SamsÂ  I haven't had Dune in my mind, but yes I did love Dune, and as a big fan of the books I love it"
Â @Adrian HebertÂ  And that movie was decent I was there probably one of the few like you said.
why is it evil tho? real question
"Â @Tim ElÂ  Very well said, it is only computer animation and witchcraft that attracts the audience now a days which is nothing compared to well scripted movie."
"Â @Hendo CalrissianÂ  the Northman is the type of movies that were made in the past on the regular, Blockbuster days.  A well scripted movie which was not all computer animation."
Â @TwoCan SamsÂ  You mean the remake?
Â @Sapphire VilyaÂ  Yes well said!
"Â @Hendo CalrissianÂ 
The amount of good movies nowadays is laughable in comparison to the amount of great movies from the 60s and 70s. 
In fact, I can't in good conscience call anything that has been released in the past 15 years a masterpiece. Maybe Fury Road? And that's an action movie, quite odd."
"Â @Warrior 4CHRISTÂ  Indeed, exept dune"
"Â @Warrior 4CHRISTÂ  Dune 2021, not really a remake its based off of a book."
this just in 113k likes 1.5m dislikes how is this possible
People are so dramatic about everything
Itâ€™s a show not the end of the world
Â @DonnieÂ  Dramatic is cool
Â @Tim ElÂ  I have a feeling that youâ€™re biased on how cool it is to be dramatic
Â @Tim ElÂ  I actually donâ€™t disagree with your point but thatâ€™s not what I meant
"I will enjoy this show even more thinking of all the tears of the toxic nerds lol.
Thank you losers, for keeping me entertained as I wait for the show."
Â @ìƒˆë¡ ì´tvÂ  What is the matter with you?
Â @Whiterun guardÂ  if you know you know
Â @Mikey NoahÂ  but why? Please tell me why do you guys not like this?
"Â @Hendo CalrissianÂ  I mean Sonic 2 is also for kids, probably shouldnâ€™t take your kids to go see The Northmanâ€¦"
Â @TwoCan SamsÂ  Have you seen Fury Road?
"Â @Yeah well,that's just, like, your opinion, manÂ  Have you seen Arrival?"
"The Scoundrel's Cantina It's glorious, is it not?"
"Well at least this show won't be canon, so there is that."
Where might i see one of the screenshots you mentioned?  I'd like to see.
Â @This 'n ThatÂ  you can get a browser extension where you can still see the dislikes. Right now it's at 1.5 million dislikes
Â @This 'n ThatÂ  it's 1.5 millions dislikes now
a mistake they will not repeat in future ... evil is evolving ;S
"over 20,000 comments have been deleted. Even if it was the same thing over and over it was foolish of them to do so, that only added wood to the fire. My they burn in the flames they have created."
"when you use the ""return youtube dislike"" chrome extentions it shows 1,5 million dislikes"
Â @eÂ  It was at 1.8 dislikes only a few weeks ago. 3 million before that. Honestly it would probably be 4 million or more dislikes if they weren't deleting them.
Â @Galan AKA GalactusÂ  yeah
"It's at 1.6m dislikes now, not 3m+"
"Â @KolikoasdpvpÂ  hence, removing dislikes."
"Iâ€™m on my phone so canâ€™t get the extension, whatâ€™s the dislikes now? Like 1.8m-1.9m?"
"Â @Dante McmillanÂ  115k likes, 1.6m dislikes currently"
"There are also google extensions. There are currently only  1.6M dislikes, which means they must have deleted a good chunk of them somehow. Which is funny because you can't even see them without extensions... goddamn"
"Dislikes aren't being deleted!

If you're using the show YouTube dislikes extension, then you have to understand that extension doesn't actually know the real number of dislikes, because the dislike data has been removed from YouTube's API. It can only make an estimation, which I assume is done by taking the ratio of dislikes of people using the extension and then using that ratio along with the actual like count to produce the number of dislikes.


For example, if you have 3 real likes, 1 extension like (1 person using the extension, 2 people not) and 1,000,000 extension dislikes, then the calculated number of dislikes is 3,000,000. But if the number of extension likes increases by one to make it 2 extension likes and 1,000,000 extension dislikes, then the calculated number of dislikes is 1,500,000."
"O que estÃ£o fazendo ?? NÃ£o tive a oportunidade de ler Tolkien ainda, o trailer pareceu bom. O que aconteceu ??"
"Â @Lay SouzaÂ  porque nÃ£o tem nada a ver com o universo de Tolkien. Elfos nÃ£o sÃ£o assim, nÃ£o tem gente destas cores etc..."
"Â @FenkersÂ  Ah, sÃ³ por isso. Pensei tinham mudado algo relevante, que fosse mudar a histÃ³ria."
"Â @Lay SouzaÂ  Mas mudaram. Tem personagens que nÃ£o existem nessa time line, introduziram hobbits nesta era sendo que eles ainda nÃ£o existem, a galadriel nem Ã© do jeito que esta sendo retratada... Tem varias inconsistÃªncias basicas pra quem gosta de Tolkien"
"Â @Lay SouzaÂ  esse personagem que aparece no trailer (o elfo negro), nÃ£o existe no livro, Ã© um personagem inventado pela Amazon, entÃ£o sÃ³ pelo trailer jÃ¡ estÃ¡ claro que irÃ£o fazer alteraÃ§Ãµes na histÃ³ria original distorcendo ela"

Funny how over 100k comments suddenly became 45k..
It went from 3.1M dislikes to 1.5M... Wow.. Amazon is really trying to protect this crap.
Amazon removed 1.5 million dislikes.
No
"yup, this looks like it's gonna suck"
"get the ""return youtube dislikes"" extension so you can see all the dislikes"
One and a half million paws down I support also gives. It is a cash jump to sell in as many countries as possible.
"1.5m dislikes, nice"
Lord of the ringsâ€¦..but not really
"What's happening ? Why everyone dislikes it ?
I don't know anything about Tolkien"
"Please do us a favor and leave the lord of the rings franchise untouched by ""the message"". Today's era is not a good time to create a prequel to this masterpiece. Just bury it somewhere deep and wait for better times, if you are so scared of the minority of activists that actually care about Tolkien's lore."
#AD?
Just leave Lord of the Rings alone. Haven't we earned that much.
So they really wasted a billion dollars
"112k likes, and over 1.5 MILLION dislikes. 

On my chrome extension"
"Amazon just deleted my dislike and one of my old comentary, but never mind that I come back for the satisfaction of disliking these abomination again. You will never destroy Tolkien's work, no matter how hard you try, he is timeless and loved by his true fans."
1.5 millions dislikes.........HA HA HA HA AHA HAHAHAHAAHAHHA
Technically 3.1 to 1.3 then it went up again a little
It was over 3 milliion. They removed half the dislikes.
Â @Michael ShaneÂ  huh
because it has diversity and inclusion! the racist and white supremes are mad
Â @David NonyaÂ  when the blind try to lead the blind.
"The showrunners dislike Tolkien and that is evident in this trailer by overturning what he built, in order to implement their own ideology"
It isn't the story and they are destroying main characters.
"They corrupted a timeless masterpiece of mythology in a cheap modern series, disrespecting the lore, chaning the characters and inventing new ones. The power of money can only corrupt, and they are using the name of Tolkien to profit from it."
"For example they changed a king character making him the advisor of his nephew, who they made queen. Just to be more ""feminist"". This is not being feminist, this is disrespecting the writings od Tolkien everyone knows and loves."
Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  What's different from Tolkien's work ?
Â @L NAPHÂ  What is their story about and what is Tolkien's about ?
Â @BoycottamazonlotrÂ  How so ? What in the trailer is different from Tolkien's work ?
Â @BoycottamazonlotrÂ  So you guys already know the characters ?
"Â @asapdammohÂ  They are setting this world thousands of years before Lord of the rings, before the Wizards travelled to Middle Earth, before harfoots evolved into Hobbits and before harfoots played a role in the story of middle earth. And still they have teased wizards and hobbits which make no sense, its like putting winston Churchill in the Pelopannesian war. Tolkiens work was heavily influenced by his Catholic faith and Amazon have repeatedly shown disdain for Christians in their works so its highly likely that the overarching themes of Tolkien and Rings of Power will be vastly different, if not contrary to one another"
Â @asapdammohÂ  In regards to Geladriel and Elrond the showrunners have described these characters in a Vanity fair article and they are different to how Tolkien wrote them
Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  This is such a shame.

"Narcissistic individuals always overestimate their skill and accomplishments  The makers of this show would feel proud after vandalizing the Sistine Chapel. Deep down they know they can't stand on their own name, or else they wouldn't need Tolkien's name stamped on their own story."

"I've been a Tolkien fan since I had The Hobbit read to me as a little kid. I'll withhold my judgement about this new series (it could go either way but it looks incredibly underwhelming), but I gotta ask how many of you guys would've been willing to dislike bomb the trailers for those ""Hobbit"" movies even though they were INCREDIBLY unfaithful to both the text and spirit of Tolkien's work. 

That is, if it IS lack of fidelity to source material that's motivating this OVERWHELMINGLY negative reaction ğŸ¤”"

"Just get the browser extension, ""Return Youtube Dislikes.""  It's currently sitting at 1,514,088, though there is reason to believe that Youtube has removed more than 1.6M of them."
"Â @TheOtherTedÂ  
Y'know what, that's totally a fair point. As needlessly stretched out as those Hobbit movies were, they could certainly hold your attention. Though I would mostly attribute that to how INCREDIBLY played out and absurd the action scenes are."
"Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  I had the audiobook read by Martin Shaw on cassette as a kid - I listened to it so many times over and over again, for years, that it eventually literally wore the tape-stuff out. I now have the INCREDIBLE version read by Andy Serkis (Gollum) himself , he also reads the audio versions of Lord of the RIngs, yussss :D Who reads your copy?"
"Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  - regarding your comment that says you liked the main cast (I agree, I loved them all!) but you had qualms the tone - the book is both epic adventure and children's fairytale so they technically did a great job at preserving that exact tone from the book and adapting it into movie format :D"
"Don't worry.  YT will remove it for you again.

Remember all those people who said, ""I wish I could dislike this more than once!""?  YT is just fulfilling their wish."
"Tolkien died for this, smh"

I wonder why they havn`t disabled commenting and voting yet....
I thought it's another Harry Potter offshoot... though I think it might be belittling HP
in my opinion.... it feels like this doesn't even have something to do with Lord of the Rings. It doesn't give me the same feeling... the happy and nostalgic feeling i get whenever i watch LOTRğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­
I think this will be a masterpeice . Many places i have seen people got some issues with Lord Of The Rings Tv Series . But frankly speaking i think this will be a hell of a performance as a matter of fact.
Just stick to the original content instead of hijacking something for your own personal views. If your own personal views can't be supported by your own original content then perhaps your views aren't any good. I and my family will pass on this too! So tired of Hollywood types.

Iâ€™m sick of people only complaining. Remember that $$MONEY$$ talks, itâ€™s the only way theyâ€™ll ever learn. Annihilate this abomination BEFORE it occurs, please Iâ€™m begging you. Protect the works of Tolkein, please."
"Well, I guess Sauron is a straight white male?"
To be honest I'm not even a Tolkien fan but I feel like I'll watch this series just to know why teenage boys are getting so triggered lmfao

"""We made a promise to ourselves at the beginning of the process that we weren't going to put any of our own politics, our own messages or our own themes into these movies.

"Iâ€™m disappointed.  Amazon, remember that the LOTR story is set in history.  If you want to reflect the present or change the future, then you need a different story.  An attempt to change history, whether real or fictional, is a form of gaslighting.   Nevertheless, itâ€™s obvious that so much money was sunk into this project that couldâ€™ve been used for something much more productive."

Overuse of CGI. Same issue with the Hobbit is now playing out here.
"Â @InfinityÂ  I feel like the Hobbit actually tried to do good by the source material, but the main problem was that they tried to stretch the contents of a single book into a nearly 6 hour trilogy, just to milk money.

This series is making no attempt to do good by the source material and is a soulless corporate product milking the name recognition for money."

Way to ruin a franchise in one trailer. This looks / sounds nothing like LOTR or the Hobbit. I don't even want to give this a chance. Hopefully somebody will come out with a sequel when the rights to Tolkins movies are up. Anything will be better than this garbage. Way to go on wasting a billion + dollars on a garbage production of LOTR. None of what you are doing is staying true to the trilliogy that's probably why they don't want to give the rights up.

"Again with the strawmen, the reason people are upset is because this work is unfaithful to the source material and you know this because you wrote ""SOUNDS"" in all caps.

You just want to set up your own argument and you knew if people corrected you, you could do the typical wokist thing of saying ""well it sounds like this to me"" because it's easier to ignore reality than face it"
"Sorry but this isnt middle earth, it doesnt feel like middle earth or look like it. We all know that you superfans have never read lotr, if you did you would instantly know what is wrong with this series"
Â @TheOtherTedÂ  you tripping . I was clearly referring to you personally.
"Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  I was a lonely kid in Brazilian countryside. I read it all when I was 15. Also, I am not an English speaker, so I did not understand all the judgement. Btw, I just liked one of the hobbits movies."
"Â @Anne FernandaÂ  You didn't understand all the judgement but still happy to refer to someone as racist. As someone who also speakd multiple languages if i didnt understand something i would withhold my own judgement of the situation, maybe you should do the same"
"Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  I should not. It is similar to things I have seen so far. People are talking here in these comments about the series trying to be inclusive in a bad way (with many different words) I have not seen a critic to the characters per se, just the choice of actors. If It swimns like a duck, quacks like a duck and eats a like a duck ğŸ¦†....."
â€‹Â @Anne FernandaÂ  You're embarrassing yourself. Evidently you don't understand what's going on here. I suggest you to inform yourself before talking.
"Â @Sebastian FielÂ  oh, ok. If I difer I just do not understand what the clever and mighty opinion is. Thanks man"
"Â @Sebastian FielÂ  I suggest you try to understand that I am being critic with people that is attacking the series diversity. If the story and storytelling is bad, like the hobbit is, I will criticize it too. But seconds of fast scenes tell nothing about what really matters, for now I can only see the effects are good."
"â€‹Â @Anne FernandaÂ  I understand you perfectly. Again: You are oblivious about the situation and the context of the situation. If you don't educate yourself before talking, nobody is going to take you seriously."
"Â @Sebastian FielÂ  no, I am not oblivious. And you are being arrogant. I read everything Tolkien wrote, I watched every fantasy movie I could get my hands on, but please, tell me how you mighty educated yourself to have an opinion about a tv series??? Please share your wisdom"
"Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  superfan of the books, specially the Silmarillion. But you are right in pointing that I am not not aware of everything the series has been doing, but again, I am a critic of people that are currently just talking about diversity, and there's a lot of it in these comment section. That is my only point, these comments are addressing only the cast choice, not other points of the series."
"Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  I ignored nothing. You guys lack the will to understand that my critic is to the MANY that focus on cast ONLY, I am just pointing my finger to the ones atacking the series for the cast choice, and if no one understands that this is my only point, that is not my problem. The lack of lore I will judge when the time comes, but certainly I will not bother with this kind of critic. And if they indeed destroy galadriel I will cry a river and burn the series with you."
"Â @Anne FernandaÂ  The cast choice is not diversity, that is called forced diversity"
"Â @Anne FernandaÂ  ""I ignored nothing"" 
Proceeds to ignore basically every comment on the trailer and the comments to her about how this show slaughters the story and primary characters of middle earth."
"So Just to ask because you are super focused on one of many issues with this series as presented so far, why do you want Tolkiens fantasy to look like West coast America rather then Middle Earth... Why is wanting the world to look like middle Earth a Problem? As a side note and as you should know within Middle Earth there is Plenty of Diversity particularly in humanity so why not use that and make a story around that rather then changing the cultural makeup of the pre existing fully described civilizations in middle Earth?

Like I say this is one of my few issues with this series but since you seem to be fine with Beardless Dwarves, Galadrials character being significantly weakened, short haired Elves, Wizards turning up something like 2,000 years early etc etc and you are trying to push this one point then you need to explain the issue with the source material.
I would never consider changing the Shannara chronicles (mutated humans from America into lots of different races including Elves and Dwarves etc) because it would not be true to the source material and so not the Shannara Chronicles anymore, on top of this as someone from Britain this is literally cultural art and heritage you are talking about and it actually matters."
"Â @Lil FishÂ  but I am only criticizing the one thing that bothered me. How difficult is to understand that? Why would I say anything about good critics that has nothing to do with what I said before? 
I can't understand how you guys are having so much mental trouble in a simples thing. I am accusing only the type of critics that I disagree completely.. how hard it is? I have nothing against people that are mad because they are erasing characters. My only point is against people that just use the diversity card against the series. I can't believe it is so hard to understand something so simple ."
"Â @DelogrosÂ  if they weakened Galadriel I will be mad for sure. These points you Brought are fair! And it's not against it that I am talking. I will try to be clearer, the only critics I am against are the ones that use ONLY the diversity card. That's it, not that hard."
"Â @Anne FernandaÂ  That's reasonably fair, if that is there only argument they are using but even that argument has a solid logical base from the source material but that's fine at least I can get behind the sentiment of the issue you would have if nothing else."
"Â @Anne FernandaÂ  You repeated a few messages ago, ""my critic is to the MANY that focus on cast ONLY"" in the comments...which is almost no one, AFTER everyone here shared their REAL problems with this show. It's almost like you don't listen to what people say, and just want to slander people ğŸ¤”"

"Â @Lil FishÂ  I neve said that, period."
"Â @Anne FernandaÂ  so they are changing the story and main characters in middle earth. Does that bother you? Because that's what bothers everyone else. If that bothers you, why don't you see everyone feels the same as you?"
Â @Anne FernandaÂ  or maybe it doesn't bother you and you choose to call people racists to try to discredit their valid complaints about this show. Slander is a really vile and cowardly act against people with a genuine grievance. It is to try to destroy someone's name.

Remember, we are not the target audience, the normies are, which means it's imperative to move against Amazon and win the normies to our side and we do that by telling them why this show is trash and that can only be achieved by watching the episodes. 

Although, do not watch from your Prime account."
"There are ways of watching it without giving any support, my young padawans ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‰"

they want to change the future as well. this is just the beginning.
Why it has 1.5million dislikes
This series is dead before it even began. A shamefull and cringeworthy adaption of one of the most important stories and literature of all time. Amazon has spat on the legacy left by JRR Tolkien. Disgraceful Amazon.
This is a insult a smack to the face a kick to the balls I mean seriously what is this Iâ€™m tried of people destroying a good/successful franchise with remakes or newer versions but this hell no pls cancel this asap.
"I sincerely hope this â€œadaptationâ€ gets the most downvotes in the history of tv reviews.

Any reviewer in favor of this series should be forever shunned because theyâ€™re obviously writing positive reviews because they were paid / told to.

I mean, 100k likes to 1.5M dislikes and it seems 2 weeks ago it was 3M dislikes so theyâ€™ve been busy it seems!!"

"Itâ€™s not the first time â€œpolitical activistsâ€ has tried to ruin Tolkiens work and accuse him of being racist! â€œClaiming that the orcs represents Asians, nazis, pocs or that dwarfs represent jews, or that only the â€œsouth and eastâ€ could aline with the evil and that the west/ north- the Caucasian are the heroâ€™s and even the elves would be Caucasiansâ€¦. Those who actually knows Tolkiens work, where it got inspired from and history! Knows itâ€™s not true! Sadly now these uneducated political activists who see only racism in this world has gotten a hold of Tolkiens work! And theyâ€™re only censoring and replacing these amazing stories with unnecessary diversity/ inclusion politics that is actually only offensive! If they knew the history theyâ€™d knew a lot better! Elves are invented in the far Northern Europe long long time ago, and there are many versions of them, fairyâ€™s â€œfemale creatures that enchanted men either with magic or lured them in Forrest so they would never be found again, nymphs, light elves, brighter than the sun, angelic beings, dark elves, black elves who lived under the ground and was amazing craftsmen, their black skin didnâ€™t refer to pocs but a pale black skin that doesnâ€™t actually exist and they were evil! Also theyâ€™ve been associated with demons, little gnomes, even Santa came from here! Not to mention dwarfs are a type of elves- black elves. Who was dead sensitive to the sun! In folklores about dwarfs they were expert craftsmen, tall even in some stories, regarding to bearded men. Rarely are any dwarf women mentioned. Also the early and different words for elves means white one! This is where Tolkien drew his inspiration from! A early medieval Northern Europe, where pocs didnâ€™t yet exist, the lands beyond was unexplored and mysterious! Thatâ€™s why in the stories the south and the east are these mysterious places but they arenâ€™t orcs. Theyâ€™re men! Corrupted who wants power and corruption exists everywhere in middle earth, even among the elves and not all men is evil in the south or the east. There are good people there who fights the evil and corruption. And If you know Tolkiens work you know some of the evils strong seats is in the north! And if you also know the stories of Tolkiens work you know that the orcs are captured elves tortured and corrupted into foul life forms! And the â€œelvesâ€ are the good guys in thisğŸ˜‚ â€œCaucasiansâ€ so yeah all these accusations debunked by a amateur. Then you can debate if the orcs was referred to Nazis because of the warâ€¦ but Tolkien discarded that so we gotta take his word for it. He canâ€™t subtitle a msg like that without standing behind it. And tbh I donâ€™t think anyone thinks orcs are Asians or other pocsâ€¦ only messed up people like the ones making this tv series believes thatâ€¦ surely not us true fans! And all this â€œpowerful warrior womenâ€, taking no orders from men, or short haircuts on elves and beardless dwarfs shows that they understand nothing about European history, culture or significance of hair. Hair is a symbol of strength through history and culture and also in Tolkiens works. â€œBut perhaps thatâ€™s offensive to bald people?â€ I donâ€™t knowğŸ˜‚ this is how Amazon thinks. Elves power comes from magic and wisdom specially Galadriels! Not from wielding a sword or leading armies. Thatâ€™s just a princess Xena warrior princess silly thing. Itâ€™s fine if you want a tv serie about a female besting all the men. â€œBut when you think you have to put that in in every single movie, tv serie you make just so youâ€™re not offensiveâ€¦ then youâ€™re offensive! Specially since most of this powerful women goes out on emasculate and humiliate men and swap them out from their roles. Its extremely offensive and silly to watch these Super hero women with no real struggles because theyâ€™re just born awesome and betterâ€¦ itâ€™s offensive to women as well! Saying that their roll to humanity isnâ€™t worth anything. â€œYes women and men where born with different roles for survival.â€ Not to mention you canâ€™t make any fantastic stories about a powerful hero woman if you make it over and over. It was also extremely rare with warrior females and leaders in history so making them about 50% with the males is just a false representation of history â€œagain to satisfy some modern day politics.â€ There where some women who made it doe and their stories are worth telling! Itâ€™s the same with the love stories about elves and men in Tolkiens work, itâ€™s supposed to be a rare thingâ€¦. But we saw Arwen and Aragorn, Tauriel and Kili- made upâ€¦ bad! And now this Amazons poc elf with a â€œpoc single motherâ€ because that was important to throw in or something. Either way Amazonâ€™s misses the very thrilling and exciting reference to the beautiful elves/ nymphs or fairyâ€™s who lures men inâ€¦ in Tolkiens version elves are more kind but still the fairest of all and he uses the elves to refer to his wife as one to show how much he adored her, suggesting sheâ€™s an angelic, perfect being whoâ€™s beauty puts a spell on him and everyone she meets. â€œFor Luthien or Tinuvielâ€ is a elvish name given to her for her beautiful singing and sheâ€™s a fairy/ angel who enchants everyone with her songs and beauty. Sheâ€™s the fairest and possibly one of the mightiest beings in the entire middle earth universe. â€œGo read the story Beren and Luthien! Itâ€™s one the most beautiful stories ever written! Also every elf relationship with a man has had a significant meaning to the story. Something Amazon misses as wellâ€¦ since these are both made up characters they canâ€™t actually have any real meaning to the story. Also by making a dark elf- evil elf a poc you have by your own making said: pocs are evilâ€¦ good job amazon! So what has amazon actually done? Theyâ€™ve taken the story, censored, replaced and not followed the storyâ€¦ â€œstrange since itâ€™s the story we want to seeâ€ theyâ€™ve turned it from a medieval setting into a modern day cosplay with gender inclusion and diversion politics. Theyâ€™ve hired low tier actors and producers so amazon gets full control of doing what they want with the series. Theyâ€™ve offended the entire fanbase and accused everyone who doesnâ€™t like their lazy poorly execution of Tolkiens works and Tolkien himself for racist and misogynist. Oh yeah theyâ€™ve also called us anonymous online trollsğŸ¤” â€œthen theyâ€™ve tried trick our opinions with â€œfake hired actors and called them super fansâ€, had experts come in and lied for them, censored and removed memes, dislikes and commentsâ€¦"

Yo llevo leyendo las historias de Tolkien desde posiblemente hace mas tiempo que todos ustedes vivos. Fueron instrumental para mi desarrollo y mi crecimiento, y una parte fundamental de sus historias era el mundo fantastico, ajeno a nosotros que el nos presentaba. Su grandeza era que la gente es tan luminosa y extrana que no podemos imaginarlo. Cuando tratan de incluir a todo la humanidad en una pelicula que trata sobre la Tierra Media, seres tan sobrenaturales que pasman el pensamiento, queda corta y no se ve bien. Si fuera la historia de la tierra como evoluciono en el siglo XXI pues esta bien. Pero no me parece, suerte con su producto pero no lo veremos."

"100% Agree. I'm a big fan of LotR and this teaser is barely feels like LotR.
Without the name (as you said) and without the caption ""Before X/Y/Z"", I would be hard pressed to guess it is LotR."
Same thing could be said of the Halo series
Remember that the lord of the rings is an adaptation of a book so the visuals all depend  on the imagination of the screen writers. Tolkien wasn't there when the first films were made but we grew to love them. So give it time.
"Â @Domi niQ Official F.A.M.EÂ  there's a reason the vast majority of people love the LotR trilogy and are not fans of the Hobbit trilogy. Peter Jackson did an amazing job with one and was criticized for the other. The Hobbit was not as well done, it introduced aspects that were not in the book, and there were inconsistencies with the dwarves Peter had already portrayed. This show is already showing that there are already character and aesthetic inconsistencies, so why would it be a surprise that fans are upset? People didn't ""grow"" to appreciate those movies. They pretty much like LotR immediately, and disliked the Hobbit without changing their minds later."
True
Â @WaffleÂ  Are you a fan of the LotR movies or books? The widely praised LotR movies are quite removed from the books.
"''incredibly far removed''? Have you ever read the Lord of the Rings and compared the movies to the books? The movies are great, but they are quite removed from the books."
"Â @ReekÂ  
Why cant I be a fan of both? Because I am. I love all the extra details and lore in the book(s) and I also love the trilogy, which is in my opinion one of the greatest (if not THE) movies of all times. Sure the movies has its flaws but that's fine because nothing in life is perfect."
"Â @WaffleÂ  There is nothing wrong with loving the LotR movies. I like them too. But many people complain that the Amazon series is removed from Tolkiens work, though they haven't seen it yet, while they like the movies, which are removed from the books. Over 6 months we will know whether the show sucks or not, and whether it stays true to Tolkiens work."
This feels like a game of thrones show...nothing like LOTR
"Only similarity is the costumes lmao, and even then they look worse"
"Â @ReekÂ  but they are adding characters that are not in the books, sure the trilogy removed tom bombadil, but the rest of the movie align with books."
"Â @ReekÂ  Iâ€™m going to give it a chance but I donâ€™t have my hopes up, for one the show shouldnâ€™t have Hobbits and itâ€™s going to."
"Â @Michael PeckÂ  You forget that the LOTR trilogy was also criticized by Tolkien fans for it changing things from the book. And people who have not seen the appendices from The Hobbit extended trilogy (The extensive and incredibly well-made BTS to the movies) wouldn't realize what truly plagued The Hobbit trilogy. Peter Jackson and his crew had years to prepare  the LOTR trilogy whereas with The Hobbit trilogy due to licensing issues he only had 5-6 months to prepare for it before filming. Not only that, Peter Jackson only wanted there to be 2 films, also didn't even want to direct the films in the first place and initially handed the reins over to Guillermo del Toro."
Â @É¹ÇÊÉ”á´‰Ê ÊqÉqÂ  who asked
Â @ReekÂ  Did you watch and read the books yesterday?
"Â @ReekÂ  Define far removed from the books. Even the film dialogues are from the books. A minor love plot was added but what ""far removed from the books"" are you talking about here? Length of consumption? Description? Nonexistant new characters?"
"Â @Aryana joÂ  I said that the movies were quite removed from the books. Some of the differences with the books are understandable or necessary, but Peter Jackson went too far in some places, particularly in changing established characters. Aragorn, Frodo, Gimli, Faramir and Denethor are far removed from how they were in the books, and not in a good way."
"Â @AE3587Â  I watched the books yesterday, but I read them years ago."
"Â @ReekÂ  Dont lie, you did that yesterday. There is no othrr explanation for you to be missing the obvious problem with this show"
"Â @ReekÂ  If you think that changing a small handful of things in the LOTR movies is the equivalent of completely making up an entire new storyline with new magical artifacts, creatures and characters which are mentioned nowhere in any of Tolkien's work, then you are being willfully ignorant."
Â @AE3587Â  ''the obvious problem with this show''?
"Â @ReekÂ  Nah, superfans are better kept in ignorance, if you dont understand the problem thats beacuse you dont care"
"Â @AE3587Â  Have you read the books? If so, which ones?"
Â @ReekÂ  Dont worry about it
Â @Michael PeckÂ  The biggest problems with the Hobbit movies are the overuse of bad CGI and the really bad action scenes and build up of suspense.

"Â @ReekÂ  i would guess that the series will be diverse, most likely some overpowered women characters who can't lose a fight. 30% of time should be allocated to explaining what is mansplaining. This series will be a blast!"
"Â @Deus est mortuusÂ  Maybe so, maybe not. I hope we will see a homosexual black wizard."
"Â @ReekÂ  Gay Morgan Freeman wizard, that would be something. Oh wait, they have to actually be homosexual in real life in order to pass the audition.

But on a serious note, they can be any sexuality or gender or whatever, as long as it is not the focus point of the plot and characters make sense and live through some struggles, nice story would be good too. Considering how majority of movies/shows fail at that, i'm pretty pessimistic"
"Â @Deus est mortuusÂ  Gay Morgan Freeman wizard would piss off a lot of people. That makes it worth it.

To be honest, I'm completely tired of the diversity debate. I don't care about the gender or skin color of the characters. I don't like it when people of color are cast just for the sake of diversity, or when women are added just for feminism. I think the most suitable actors should be cast. But it is not a major issue to me.

The most important thing is whether the show is well-written. If the show has a good story, has good characters and is mostly faithful to the source material, then I am satisfied."
"no, nobody would associated with Peter Jackson's movies.   You kids can't seem to imagine any imagery beyond what Jackson showed you.  Those of us that read the books long before the trilogy movies came out can imagine a world that doesn't look exactly like that"
The last time I checked this video had over three million dislikes and now it only has 1.5 million. They are removing millions of dislikes
Even though I am a big fan of lotr I wouldn't mind if the changes are good. It's a series they can't just copy paste for very obvious reasons. It would be nice to changes made by them as long as the show remaind remarkable. Expectations are pretty high might even shatter pretty quickly.
Â @Vidhi KapoorÂ  What many of us don't understand is why making a fanfic with dozens upon dozens of OCs and plot elements vaguely inspired in Tolkien's work instead of just an original IP? This would have had so much more potential as an original story set in an original universe.
Â @É¹ÇÊÉ”á´‰Ê ÊqÉqÂ  it didnâ€™t really. Sarumanâ€™s death in the two towers was far from how his demise occurred in the books as well.
Agreed
Â @Michael PeckÂ  funny that you think there weren't inconsistencies with the LOTR trilogy from book to film
Â @ReekÂ  I disagree with your comment about Aragorn. Tolkien was great at broad character development and you can see that in the change and development of Galadriel. But he isn't known for his character development and he doesn't need to be. But the characters in his stories are very one dimensional and don't grow all that much or change. In a movie you need growth in characters. And aragorn was a perfect place for that growth.
Â @Henry ForakerÂ  I didn't say there weren't. But the overall adaptation is far better than is the case with the Hobbit. I said there were inconsistencies between the dwarves in LotR and in the Hobbit
Â @InfinityÂ  this doesn't feel like a game of thrones show lol..
As someone who's only recently got into the legendary movies and books going from watching the Return of the rings extended cut to this trailer feels jarring. Just feels like a Game of thrones wannabe with a Lord of the Rings paint job.
"Â @Dayn LeonardsonÂ  LOTR movies are based on books which cover very very small period of time in the vast history of Arda, and those books are very well detailed and served as a script for its self. Silmarilion was written more like a history book covering only the major plots and characters since the begining of time up until 3rd Age, so it's not so well detailed as other books. Now imagine creating a long lasting tv show with for example seven or eight seasons covering again a very small part of the entire history of Arda with close to none material to begin with, only the major characters. You have to make additional characters, plots, artifacts etc. Of course they gonna do that"
"Â @Marko VicoÂ  It's pretty clear that those writing this TV series simply don't understand the heart of Tolkien's work. That's the major issue. People don't necessarily care as much about new content being invented in Tolkien's universe IF it seems to fit with the already established lore. But in a one minute trailer, they already altered said lore. I don't give a crap about having different races as characters. I get that part, but I'm talking about other lore based changes.

If you don't have much  to go off of for story specifics, why change the little lore you DO have?  It shows a lack of respect to the author, and people that complain about Star Wars fans being picky pricks have clearly never met LOTR fans. Biggest purists I've ever come across. If you're wondering what changes I'm referring to, you can read through the comments on this video. It's being discussed quite a bit in some threads.

The proof will be in the pudding my friend. Watch this show, with a record shattering budget, absolutely flop like a fish. 

I personally will give it a proper shot. I don't expect much and hopefully will be pleasantly surprised. But I'm an odd one out. None of my other Tolkien obsessed friends are even going to watch it, according to them. So I'm calling it now, the show flops unless it somehow hits that level of mainstream appeal GoT enjoyed. I just don't really see that happening with LOTR. The morally ambiguous nature of GoT doesn't mesh with the traditional light vs dark based lore of Tolkien. So if that's what they want to do, they picked the wrong lore to do it with and clearly don't understand the source material."
Â @É¹ÇÊÉ”á´‰Ê ÊqÉqÂ  The trilogy removed the end part where the 4 hobbits return to the shire and raise the hobbits to arms to overthrow Saruman
"Â @Antony NjorogeÂ  I've read the books, that fact is well known by me, but you gotta take in the account the reasons behind the removal of the scene. Peter Jackson must've of felt the scene to be useless. He definitely didn't do it for any of his political reasons. That is the main difference, where changes in the trilogy were dedicated to sharpen the story, while the TV show (from the trailer) throws black ink into a well written poem."
"Yep, definitely agree"
"Â @ReekÂ  If you think the books/movies were far removed, then this series can't even be considered LOTR"
Pure truth!
"Â @unkÂ  I think the movies were quite removed, I didn't say far.
And this series hasn't aired yet; it's not clear how much it will differ from the source material."
"Â @ReekÂ  maybe, but they said that they were avoiding tolkiens writings, e.g. making Galadriel a combatant, which she isnâ€™t in anything really"
Â @Domi niQ Official F.A.M.EÂ  Ye and his son said that the original movies are nothing like tokien himself imagined middle earth at all. But theyre probably what most people in this comment section think of when they think of lotr..
Â @Domi niQ Official F.A.M.EÂ  Depend on how much you know about lotr.
"Boo hoo, boycott it then."
Â @R. HegnerÂ  this is satire right?
Â @I LiÂ  I demand representation! Itâ€™s a human right!  REPRESENTATION!
Â @ReekÂ  I donâ€™t think movies are suppose to be exactly like the book. This is creative art. A director designs a Vision based on a plot or references from a book. Thatâ€™s exactly what they did. A few changes that a director or writer wants in a film doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not true to the books. If you want the exact same story just read the books

"I can't help but notice, that a lot of comments and dislikes have been removed, I wonder why that is. this is the next big thing right? as of right now, there are 29,377,242 views with ONLY 111k likes, even with out the dislikes shown, you know this NOT popular and has gotten downvoted into oblivion, rightfully so."
1.5M and counting disk likes cant be wrong.

"I read the Hobbit at 13, the Lord of the Rings shortly thereafter, and the Silmarillion by 15. I studied the old mythologies and stories that Tolkien pulled from for many of the ballads in the Silmarillion . The writers and ""creators"" of this show definitely have not read or studied the source material, and do not comprehend what is behind these stories.
Even the descriptions used for this ""trailer"" are wrong, 'the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkienâ€™s pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness.' The greatest villain and the one who covered the world in darkness was not Sauron
Anyway good luck, this has really made me reconsider where I buy things. I hope that you will either completely trash this terrible idea or lose so much money that no one will ever even attempt to use Tolkien's works again."
We hates it forever!!!
This is like when Disney made Star Wars fans really appreciate the prequels by showing them how bad Star Wars Movies could be. Hobbit Trilogy looking better and better with it's spinning barrel attack hobbits and impromptu giant molten gold statue of death.
"Uahahah i can feel IT , Its a bullshit"
Tolkien rolled over in his grave when this trailer came out!
I'm so disappointed I can never imagine another actor instead of Frodo Baggins. The Lord of the Rings is a perfect and we dont need garbage series
We fucking need Peter Jackson on this or this is going to be the biggest shitshow in the history of Hollywood

"Nobody wants to see a homosexual Aragorn or an empowered Galadriel, we want the originality that Tolkien wrote. It disgusts this agenda of inclusion and diversity. If you want to include this crap on the agenda, be creative and create something new, don't come and usurp what's established. I'm sick of this!!! Failure for Rings of Power!"
it will definitely be a flop!

Is R2-D2 gonna be in this one? He was my favourite character in the first trilogy. I love that little guy.
"With the certainty Amazon will remove this comment as they have so many other critical comments: I am going to take a hard pass on this abomination of Tolkien.  It isn't really Tolkien; it's just adding his name to some modernized nonsense that happens to misappropriate the names of Tolkien's beloved characters.  What a disappointment! I had looked forward to this series for years, and when I saw the trailer I felt so utterly let down.  This series is what happens when big money, shallow corporate thinking, marketing surveys and political agendas dictate the creation of video production.  Tolkien's literature is a work of art.  This series is its bastardized incest monster."
They did it again!! They deleted thousands of comments again!! Shame!!!!!

"â€œIt felt only natural to us that an adaptation of Tolkienâ€™s work would reflect what the world actually looks like.â€
- Lindsey Weber, E.P. Amazon's LOTR Series, Vanity Fair (Feb. 2022)

""There are certainly themes Tolkien felt were important. We made a promise to ourselves at the beginning of the process that we weren't going to put any of our own politics, our own messages or our own themes into these movies. What we were trying to do was to analyse what was important to Tolkien and to try to honour that. In a way, were trying to make these films for him, not for ourselves.""
- Peter Jackson, Interview with GreenCine (Dec. 2002)"
Donde estan los 3.1 de dislikes?
"Activism over storytelling, politics over respect for the fans. This will never work. How many times must this happen to our beloved franchises before Hollywood gets it? How many billions is Amazon planning to throw away to suppress the valid backlash of those that want Tolkien's work respected?"
Can you not just make your own stories and ruin them instead of tarnishing our childhood reading and movies???

Â @FilthtronÂ  Agreed.  YT always remove spam.  Nothing new here.
Â @Hendo CalrissianÂ  That's B.S. Not just spam is being deleted.
Â @SilverSidedSquirrelÂ  Nope. Just don't like cancel culture. Sorry. ğŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸
Just like everyone in thr comments are bots... or trolls. Not like Tolkien is the father of fantasy with a ginormous fan base. Anything to disrest honest discent.
Â @SilverSidedSquirrelÂ  lol. How is it not!? Or are you not here to grift people in to boycotting this show/amazon because this show has hurt your feelings or gone against your personal politics/agenda. ğŸ¤£
"Â @L NAPHÂ  nice strawman! ğŸ¤£ I didn't say the comments were bots. Stay on topic. 

If you think the dislikes going from being stagnet at 160k to over 3 million on a video in the span of a few days isn't suspicious then I would say your blind. Especially on a video a few months old!! ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ someone is so obviously fiddling."
Â @Hendo CalrissianÂ  well our comments have been said to have been from bots plenty of times in the comment section.
"Â @Hendo CalrissianÂ  you mention agenda and politics... no one on the side of Tolkien has an agenda, we just want agendas kept out of our fantasy and thr stories not changed. The fact you felt the need to bring up politics and agendas as the only reason we could care says everything about what drives you and not us."
"Â @Hendo CalrissianÂ  You obviously haven't been reading the comments.  See, for every comment I see of someone defending this show, I see dozens of comments calling it trash.  That tells me right there that more people dislike than like this.  They are mass deleting comments, but not nearly fast enough to stop people from seeing the negative reactions to it.  And by the way, the dislikes were WAY HIGHER a few days ago.  3.2M.  Even after fudging the numbers, they didn't dare take it below 1.4M.

The writing is on the wall.

Plus, I've read several comments of people saying that their specific dislikes were removed.  If they're commenting about it, they're not bots."
"Â @Hendo CalrissianÂ  you mean trying to save Tolkiens lifework? sure, if you  all that an agenda.

 I can get beyond forced diversity as can many others, what I cannot get beyond is destroying the story and main characters of tolkien's world against his express written wishes  and the wishes of everyone who loves his work.  

For many that is just a canary in Coal mines of the greater issue at hand, which is:

Respect the lore."
"Â @Hendo CalrissianÂ  well I'm against r4pe of historic art. This is not some poor celebrity. This is the company that doesn't want their employees to write  words like bathroom since they get docked pay for going to the bathroom, or I have a concern in the group chats. Their workers are treated like slaves."
"Â @L NAPHÂ  ""R4pe""?!  lmao.  A bit dramatic aren't we?  And sorry, but pretty sure Amazon has all the permission they needed when Tolkein's estate sold them the rights for the story they are putting together.  Perhaps you should take your complaint to them.  

You folk's false number falacy is amazing!  ha ha.  Everyone who loves his work agrees??  Plenty have liked this video.  Infact if you're looking at views to like ratios in amazon's top videos here in youtube this rates well.  Are they not fans because they don't agree with you? lol"
"Â @Hendo CalrissianÂ  you work for amazon, there's no way around it."
Deleted my replies.
"Â @Hendo CalrissianÂ  alazon broke their agreement with Tolkien's so-nn, when they chose to go back on their word to him to work within the c4n-non of his f4ther's work."
"Â @L NAPHÂ  when argued into a corner, you people become achingly predictable.  I must work for amazon, I'm a troll or I post to much etc.... yawn. And you dorks say I use the same script. ğŸ¤£

I deleted your replies now!? Lol. How exactly have I done that then!? ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£"
"Â @Hendo CalrissianÂ my reply to you was removed, and I have no problem defending myself to people who are not so cowardly to silence good points. someone from Amazon is trying to hide the truth  whether it's you or someone else. you are following this show like someone with some chips in the game. . . Not as a regular person."

Outch that's stinging
This might be the biggest contributor to why Peter Jackson's films were such a hit and why the Amazon series is going to fail.
Finally a good comment. This is a valid example to be skeptical of the show.
such difference
"Â @Howling Burd19Â  Every time I watch the movies, I notice little details that make me appreciate this masterpiece even more, even after the 20th rewatch .
Example: In The Return of the King, during the epic scene of the Rohirrim Charge, Peter Jackson requested that only extras who have read the novel and could recite the scene to be placed in the front lines as they were aware of the importance of this moment."
Â @EmiÂ   You didn't notice anything then lol
With Peter Jackson goes my undying respect however for Amazon I have more hatred than Turin had for Melkor (Morgoth)!
Peter Jackson had to fight just to even make the Lord of the rings trilogy. They wanted him to make it all 1 movie which would have been horrible.
Peter Jackson payed homage to lotr. Amazon is about to take a dump all over it.
Thing is LOTR takes place in ancient england. Which is why all the native characters are white. They are most likely Britons or celts (The Arda equivelant).
"Oh god, this is going to be horrible, isn't it."
"No pudo haber acertado de mejor manera con su comentario, es sencillamente como mirar blanco y negro."
They want the ready made fan base and the intellectual property of better men so it takes a longer time to completely fail so sadly they can't.
Disney in a nutshell:
3 M dislikes
"Yes, they did! And i've think that was impossible... 
I just wish this all crash down above their heads with a million tons of rejection"
"1,4M dislikes....hahahaha"

Just look at how abysmal the working conditions are at this company and how badly they treat their employees  Deleting a few comments barely register on the the evilness scale.

Cultural appropriation...
"Read Tolkiens Letter 210. It can easily be applied as basis for criticism  against what amazon appearingly is doing to his work. Some excerpts:
 ""I feel very unhappy about the extreme silliness and incompetence of Z and his complete lack of respect for the original (it seems wilfully wrong without discernible technical reasons at nearly every point). I should say Zimmerman, the constructor of this s-l, is quite incapable of excerpting or adapting the 'spoken words' of the book. He is hasty, insensitive, and impertinent.  He does not read books. It seems to me evident that he has skimmed through the L.R. at a great pace, and then constructed his s.l. from partly confused memories, and with the minimum of references back to the original."""
Oh yeah I really like how YT removed a lot of comments from since I was last here two months ago when this trailer dropped.
Turning a work of art into a piece of trash. Sad.
"Repect Tolkien, Danm asses!
Why you PCs ruin everything? I hope you guys Rest in Agony forerver."
The amount of Tolkien fans quoting passages from the books is just amazing

I'm glad that I cannot see the dislikes.
"Sauron could not  destroy the Middle-earth but, Amazon did it."
Oh so your deleting our comments now Amazon ay?
"First impression from a random person who spends a lot of time consuming content online  :  i was not impressed by the trailer, bad vibe :P"
Over 2 million dislikes vanish and nearly 60k comments vanish...  LOL!!
"It began with the forging of the Great Films. Rights were given to Peter Jackson. Immortal, wisest, and fairest of all beings. 

But we were all of us deceived, for another adaption was made. 

In the land of Amazon, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Bezos created in secret a disaster series to destroy all others.

And into this series he poured his money, his greed and his will to dominate existing franchises with political pandering. 

One series to ruin them all!"

The like  an dislike ratio for that video is 111k to 1.4M. Let's show them that they don't make the rules.
"The most amazingly tone deaf part of all of this is that you, as ""writers"" and ""showrunners"" felt you knew better than and had to improve upon a literal master in Tolkien.  The books have been translated into 40+ different languages.  Clearly it connected with a diverse number of people before you vandals got your hands on it.  It is your lack of imagination, your insecurity, and you deficit of talent that makes it so you can't ""see yourself in it"" and feel the need to make it ""relevant"".  Your names and abomination of a Tolkien adaptation will be quickly forgotten and people all over the world will continue to purchase, read, and love the actual works of J.R.R. Tolkien."

This looks great.
Go back into the shadowy chasm from which you came foul monster.
Can someone step up and stop this madness?
lol? Look as Iâ€™m saying. Everyone is just saying itâ€™s bad because itâ€™s not going the way Tolkien had wrote it. And include the race thing. We havenâ€™t seen the show yet. All Iâ€™m saying never judge a show by its cover. Donâ€™t say itâ€™s bad until you watch it.
"Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  I believe you. I believe itâ€™s Tolkienâ€™s novel and his writing. I just donâ€™t like all these people hating something thatâ€™s not even out yet. And making a big deal out of it. 
I think the Amazon series looks fascinating and looks something to forward to see. Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ll say. What do you think?"
"Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  you are right. They donâ€™t have the right to move Tolkienâ€™s work and shouldnâ€™t do that. But either way, I think the show, in my mind, could be something I may want to watch. 
If itâ€™s bad, then Iâ€™d say I would not recommend this show."
Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  cheers ğŸ»
Shows don't have covers. They have trailers.
Â @Michael ShaneÂ  true.
If in their teaser they show things incongruent with Tolkiens writings (which they have) and in interviews they say they don't like Tolkien and what he stood for but instead want to add THE MESSAGE into this work. I can say with complete confidence that this will be awful
Do you like the lord of the Rings movies?
Â @L NAPHÂ  it is my favorite movie of all time
Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  it probably will. But I just donâ€™t want to make considerations yet.
"Â @Sean McelhineyÂ  mine, too. It means a lot to me. The company that makes this show is fighting to get all film rights. They just got the rights to d3str1but e the h0bbi-t, and are fighting for the rights to make and dist. The trilogy. They want to erase and replace... becausw they are jealous and they can't compete with it... yet want the films to have their me55age.

Those who hold the r1tes, forgive my intentional misspelling, are fighting to keep them."
"Â @L NAPHÂ  yeah. In that part, I just wished they did follow what Tolkien had wrote and it would made a success. And I know Hobbit they added somethingâ€™s that werenâ€™t part Tolkienâ€™s work. My only wish is they should have added Tolkienâ€™s. Or couldâ€™ve made a show about the Silmarillion. It is upsetting that people want to change that idea and try to ruin the show."
"Â @Sean McelhineyÂ  same. It really is upsetting. I am open to small changes, but it seems that this is a whole other story altogether...and the fact that they might remove my fav films from market to replace them is so wrong. Tolkien's â˜   day is th3 day this show begins. That's no accident.  They are visc10us  in their behavior and their treatment of him and his work."
Â @Sean McelhineyÂ  as well as their attempts to sl-4nder and s-1l3nc-e the fans.
Â @L NAPHÂ  greedy producers. Thatâ€™s all they are.
"Â @SilverSidedSquirrelÂ  maybe Iâ€™m not. But I still have no understanding. I can only see what I can see. So I canâ€™t what may happen next. You are not so wise yourself. Neither of us are, so I apologize."
"Â @Sean McelhineyÂ  if we supoort this with our views, it only encourages them to continue to destroy what we love."

What a joke
Amazon deleted my comments from the trailer. Now when I put the comment back it is deleted within less than a minute. They are clearly running a script to suppress any negative comments from Tolkien fans. The Mouth of Sauron has revealed their hand.
"so now they delete dislike, they can take any criticism. Absolute lack of professionalism"
"Its amazing. You people from amazon have turned a beloved franchise into a burning cess pool. You have made a beloved movie adored by millions (myself included) into a heap of garbage. There were other places you guys could have explored and made it better and far more entertaining. But I know you are not going to care. I doubt you will even read this. But if you do, I hope you people from amazon will realize that your current modern day agendas and half baked ideas will never work out. Trying to achieve what Tolkien did, will end up hollow. I hope that you hang your head in shame in the hours of the night with your darkened thoughts and realize that having the best CGI, the best effects, and the best actors/actresses does not make a story. The story itself does. When you guys figure it out, I hope that sticks to your minds and I hope it sticks for a VERY long time."
i don't recognize tolkien in that

I see you came here from Nerdrotic.
"It's not his st0  rie, and they have messed up the I.mportant ch4ractur3s... and called fans and Tolkien untrue things and tried to silence the fans."
"Â @Takanome MihawkÂ  okâ€¦. Iâ€™m trying to understand where your coming from but it really sounds like everyone is getting mad at the mere existence of skin color diversity in LOTR. For me personally, itâ€™s honestly not that hard to suspend my disbelief and accept that there are multiple skin colors among the different LOTR races. So, I guess what I want to know is, in an alternate universe where you directed the show, how would you have cast it? Would you have an all white cast? Would you hire actors of different races but only limit the roles of those actors to a certain species? How would you have cast/written the show?"
"There are several reasons why Tolkien fans are not pleased with this.  You can seen Hello Future Me's video, in which he tries to take a balanced approach, but even he explains that most of these reasons are perfectly valid.

Here are a few:
1.  Amazon doesn't actually have the rights to the source material.  They only have rights to about 12 pages of material total.  This means that they're not really telling Tolkien's story, but rather their own using Tolkien's world as a backdrop.

By comparison, take a look at how much material was involved in each of these projects:

LOTR - about 1100 pages.  Three pretty good films.
HOBBIT - about 300 pages.  Three not-so-great films.
RINGS - about 12 pages.  FIVE SEASON TV SERIES.

Do the math; that should tell you the level of quality to expect.

Granted, Amazon could just have created their own fantasy story, and if it was good, we might still like it.  But there are other reasons to think it won't be.

2.  They don't really care about Tolkien's legendarium.  The trailer shows at least a couple of changes they've made to the source material.  For example, why is there a beardless Dwarf?  In Tolkien, female Dwarves have beards.

3.  Amazon has already revealed their intention to shoehorn modern social politics into Tolkien's world.  Just watch the ""Rings Superfans"" video.  They removed it because it got such negative reactions, but with some clever googling, you should be able to find it."

Much less such measures prop themselves with everything we have verbally and physically fought against for over 200 years. It will not have been done in vain."

"""It felt only natural to us that an adaptation of Tolkien's work would reflect what the world actually looks like.""
- Lindsey Weber, E.P. Amazon's LOTR Series,
Vanity Fair (Feb. 2022)

How strange of Amazon then: If they want something thatâ€™s reflecting the day and age weâ€™re living in - then why choose a piece of literature that was made 75 years ago, depicting a medieval time inspired by Keltic and Nordic roots, 500 years ago,.. 

Now, I donâ€™t think this is ruined because of the decision to alter the race of some. However, it might translate into a bigger picture with the disrespect for Tolkiens work, feeling that you have the right to alter whatever you feel like to suit you. I think that is what fans are worrying about here and what I myself worry about too: The lack of respect of the work. 

By all means, make movies with all genders and â€œraceâ€, with people all over the world. But donâ€™t make it â€œpoliticalâ€. What makes a movie good is if thereâ€™s a good story to be told to begin with, regardless of who it revolves around. Thatâ€™s what movie business (which it sadly has turned into) has forgotten. Itâ€™s about the story, not politics,.. 

If you want to make something thatâ€™s depicting todayâ€™s world? Go ahead! But then create it! Create something new,.."

Removing dislikes and negative comments isn't going to change peoples minds. Nobody asked for a mediocre interpretation of a great piece of work from Tolkien. The amateurs behind this new show are going to rip apart the story and tape it back together just to spite people that care. Censoring REAL fans and calling them racist and bigots isn't going to work. It's sad to see the aggressive way people are trying to demonize the actual fans. This is well on it's way to joining a list of all the other franchises that have been broken apart.

"The challenge is not with the people hired for creating the shown, the challenge lies in the direction of that team by a multibillion corporation that does not gives a f** about anything except money and treating people like trash.
The people hired are probably just doing what they are told."
Â @Takanome MihawkÂ  you would think if they wanted money they would hire good writers to appeal to the fan base
"Â @Toasty ToastÂ  You're right, I agree, if they knew or researched what LOTR meant for the fans, they probably would have.

But doing that would most likely mean to put more time and effort into the creation of their show and it would not surprise me that they have a schedule to fit.

I believe they are not trying to create a new artwork, rather, they are trying to produce a product that has to be cost/time efficient before the next one. And if it can sell goodies all the better.

So, they took the name for what they think is easy money, added ""mass standardized"" obligations to it (to fit the sheet of things that do well these days) and hired the last famous show(GOT) directors/specialists to run it.

So that on paper they would have ""easy money"" making product.

But when you do that taking a masterpiece like LOTR, father of fantasy, you are bound to get trashed by the many different communities that were inspired by Tolkien in the first place.
Because we expect a work of art with that name on it, not the later ""consummable bs to watch after work"" that we will forget in two days."

Amazon acting like removing comments and dislikes wonâ€™t result in us coming back to dunk on this garbage again.

"Worse, since Sauron was not evil in the beginning. Can't say the same for Amazon."
At this rate it will be the most watched premiere of any show this year.
Â @breadordecideÂ  Not how that works... Everyone knows about the slappening but the oscars got the 2nd worst views in its history.
Yet the premiere is his death day.
from a different streaming service? Cracking idea
Brilliant
Â @Mark MacMillanÂ  I think Hulu has them
"Oh, Hells yes Iâ€™m so doin that! Amazon - disgust; Perter Jackson - Respect; Tolkien - Eru level Respect!"
"Â @Hanz ZimmerÂ  HBO max has them too, and their parent company produced the movies."

Â @Hanz ZimmerÂ  its hbo
probly all already got the extended version
They were above 3 million dislikes earlier this week. They just removed 2.x million of them ğŸ¤£
Â @Robin BatchelorÂ  *and they deleted ~60k Comments
"Â @Robin BatchelorÂ  yeaaa!!! I saw comments where they said its 3M dislikes already... but as I saw I see only 1.4M, so yes they are removing dislikes... soo pathetic :DDD"
What a shame she looks like Tavra and not Galadriel. smh.
"The dislikes went from 3M, to 1.8M, and are now currently at 1.4M...all within a matter of days...why? You might have a hard time convincing me that a million people just went, ""I changed my mind.

"Before you complain about this adaptation ""dishonouring"" Tolkien's works, remember Christopher Tolkien's stance on the Jackson trilogy:  

â€œThey eviscerated the book by making it an action movie for young people aged 15 to 25â€¦ Tolkien has become a monster, devoured by his own popularity and absorbed into the absurdity of our time. The chasm between the beauty and seriousness of the work, and what it has become, has overwhelmed me. The commercialization has reduced the aesthetic and philosophical impact of the creation to nothing. There is only one solution for me: to turn my head away.â€ - Christopher Tolkien"
Funny how many comments disappeared from this comment section. Almost as if Amazon is worried about our opinions and influence. Like being called out for being creatively bankrupt ahead of release will hurt them.
ğŸ‘
''I do earnestly hope that in the assignment of actual speeches to the characters they will be represented as I have presented them: in style and sentiment.  I should resent perversion of the characters.''  J.R.R. Tolkien from letter 210 regarding adaptations of his work.  Amazon will honor the day of his death by releasing this hot garbage.

"If you read comments, several viewers are complaining that their specific dislikes were removed, and they had to click the button again.  Something fishy is going on with the dislikes on this video.  Although, to be truthful, it doesn't make sense why they would just half them, when even at half, the video is still ratioed to heck."
"Â @Thomas WrightÂ  that is fishy, indeedâ€¦maybe YouTube was trying to go with the boiling frog method. Instead of deleting every dislike at once, delete them in pieces and hope the audience doesnâ€™t noticeâ€¦.we noticed, though. ğŸ˜‚"
"I think its because they are deleting comments, the extension uses the amount of comments to likes on a video and estimates the dlislike count based on the millions of video stats they where able to scrape before youtube turned off the dislike count on the youtube API"

No, the plugin is tracking real numbers.  I just tested this out on an SCP Orientation video."
"Â @DataantiÂ  I also tested it out on a Fabis Tunes video that I had previously liked.  Not only did the dislike number go up, but the likes decreased (which it should - you can't both like and dislike a video).  When I clicked Like again, the Dislike went away.  Nope, the plugin appears to be tracking real numbers."

"It's hard to get worse than the Wheel of Time, but if anyone can do it, Amazon can."
But for some reason peters films are now sacred holy texts. So stuff he created like long hair on elves is somehow canon. And because he decided that only white elves exist thats also canon. We cannot move forward peddling the passive racism of peter and tolkien.
"Â @breadordecideÂ  As someone who is a big fan of the legendarium and even of the Jackson films (despite their flaws) the vitrol and complaining I've seen from so called ""fans"" about this series is unbelievable especially since the show hasn't even been released yet.  That they'll attack this adaptation for changes to the source material and not the ""Holy Grail"" that is Jackson's films despite the glaringly large changes they made speaks volumes I feel about what their real problems with this series is."
"Â @Kyle DoucetteÂ  Interesting that you call the peter jackson films wrong for changes that leave the story essentially intact, especially when compared to this new story that is not Tolkien's at all by this show's own admission."
"Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  Maybe Unbreaded will actually read the books so as to improve his trolling, realize what he's been missing out on, and finally understand why the negative reactions."
"Even though the story is essentially the same there are going to be changes to fit what the audience of the day wants to see, that is inevitable with any adaptation.  Jackson made films that would appeal to teenagers and young adults with lots of action/violence, stoner humour, at the expense of characterization and themes.  And by the sounds of it, this adaptation is doing something similar to try and cast as wide a net as possible.  

Don't get me wrong I love the Jackson films, but the crux of it is they are not some superior adaptation and Tolkien no doubt rolled in his grave when they came out."
Â @Kyle DoucetteÂ  the story is not essentially the same. We did not ask for this.
If they were truly interested in what the audience wants they wouldn't try to silence millions of people. They are interested in what they want and they do not represent the greater population.
Â @Lil FishÂ  You know there really isn't much of a story that this series is based on right? Just based on material from the Appendices in Return of the King which is essentially just statements about historical in-EÃ¤ events.
Â @Kyle DoucetteÂ  and yet they somehow manage to change and destroy what we do know about the main characters and story of that time.
"Â @Kyle DoucetteÂ  also, Tolkien said he would be upset I'd people didn't understand the core message of his work would try to represent it in film. These people do not understand as they are going for a GOT series, which is antithetical in philosophy to that of Tolkien."
"Â @Lil FishÂ  See you keep saying such things but don't actually explain how.  Did you also complain when Jackson fundamentally changed Denethor, Faramir, Aragorn, Gimli, Merry, Pippin, Elrond, Eowen, etc"
"Â @Kyle DoucetteÂ  with the exception of faramir (who I understand was changed to drive certain points home of the story in short time) everyone on that list was perfect to me in the films, and feel like excellent and fitting representations of their characters in movie format."
"Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  ""Piss and Vinegar Galadriel"" doesn't sound too far off the mark from her 2nd Age descriptions.  Not nearly as bad as incompetent Denethor, comedic relief Gimli, or stoner Merry/Pippin..."
Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  I read the LOTR trilogy and have seen and purchased the movies dozens of times. Try again.
Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  Youve never seen the LOTR movies? What the hell? And youâ€™re the superfan? LMFAO.
"Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  I didnt get a degree in the books, like you obviously. I have a life. Read them in 2003. I liked them. Life went on."
Â @Kyle DoucetteÂ  So the supposed superfan anjelica has never seen the movies. WOW.
"Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  When you say music, you mean the film scores or something else? Im actually curious."
Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  Very cool.

Okay. Im sure your moms account was funding the whole of the company.
How do you watch them?
"they removed half the dislikes, but you can see it using an a chrome app, return dislikes"
Â @Laura NaphtaliÂ  that app is broken.
"Â @jnalandÂ  There's a browser plugin that shows the real number.  Here's how it works:  Youtube can't just get rid of the Dislike button, despite certain studios wanting them to.  So they just altered the page code to hide the total.  However, that information still exists in the page code, and the plugin just uncovers the number.  Unbreaded keeps claiming ""that app is broken,"" but he doesn't know what he's talking about.  But nobody should pay any attention to Unbreaded; he's just a troll.

If you read the comments, several viewers have complained that their specific dislikes were removed, and they had to click the button again.  So however it might be happening - whether a glitch on YT's end or deliberate tinkering with the numbers - something odd is going on."

Fans reacted pretty much the same as you people did. There is a great reddit post that has all the links to how people threw vitriol at peter and the whole production.

"Â @Anne AnneÂ  No, you just simply asked the question.  Unbreaded is just trolling.  He/she/it/they/them/whatevertheheckelseyouwannathrowinthere seems to get off on accusing people of being white nationalists.  He seems to think that such labels actually mean anything in our culture anymore.

The real reason people are objecting to this series is two reasons:  (1) it is so obvious they didn't care about the lore.  They're not really trying to tell Tolkien's story, but to create their own using Tolkien's mythos as a backdrop, with a few recognizable characters thrown in for good measure (never mind whether those characters actually fit their roles in the original legendarium).  And (2) it's also painfully obvious that Amazon is interjecting modern politics into this work.  The evidence for this can be seen in the now-removed ""Rings Superfans"" video (you can still find it with some clever googling).

Bottom line, this isn't going to be Tolkien.  It's going to be TOKEN instead.  And yet, according to Unbreaded, pointing that out makes us the villains."
"Â @Thomas WrightÂ  
Ah okay
I really thought this is a remake of Lord of the rings then I saw the whole title and was even more confusedğŸ˜…, is this about the origin of the rings of power?
Tbh, I don't get Middle Earth vibes from this vid. It sounds and looks like it belongs to The Hobbit or another children's book. You know what I mean? ğŸ˜…There are also some shots that looks like they were from a video game or something.ğŸ˜…

Thanks for replying.
I don't know all of that but I think it make sense that a show trying to change and add stuff of their own doesn't feel like what it should be.

As for @breadordecide, I can assure you that I am not an angry white nationalist and I am sure the others who dislike this trailer have valid reasons to not watch or support the show. ğŸ˜Š"
"I was hopeful for this show, but they have changed the story, as they don't even have rights to the time they are covering, and destroyed the main characters. Jackson created a masterpiece because he said they would not insert their own messages, and would create their films as much as they could to honor Tolkien. These people are doing the opposite. They have no respect for keeping with Tolkien's story, or his wishes."
"Â @Laura NaphtaliÂ  
Thanks for explaining.ğŸ¥°
I'll find time to at least listen to the audiobooks of lotr. English is not my first language and I find it easier to listen to the story than reading long english books. Listening while doing my chores.ğŸ˜…"
"Â @Anne AnneÂ  I understand. It was hard for my mom, too, to read it, because she likes to move fast, and Tolkien takes his time. I ended up reading it to her when she was not well. She liked listening that way. Also, I really adore the movies as well."

Aragorn decapitates the Mouth of Sauron in the extended edition of RotK. That's basically character assassination.

Â @ReekÂ  why does it matter? This isn't a movie for some pre-school kids in the first place ffs
"Â @IrsyadÂ  Fundamentally changing existing characters matters a lot. I understand that Aragorn had to be given an arc in the movies (to accept becoming the king of Gondor), but in the movies he's just an over-emotional swordsman appealing to the dumb audience who haven't read the books.
A black Elf or beardless black Dwarf are minor details which won't make the show any better or worse."
"Â @ReekÂ  well, to be honest Aragorn and Faramir are the most changed characters in the movies. They weren't like the characters in the books at all"

How great would it be if they just hurried and deleted all the poop theyâ€™ve made, cut their losses and restart with literal Tolkien scholars making this series a passion project."
"To those who donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on behind the scenes, YouTube has massively deleted comments and maybe even dislike votes. This series is in hot water due to the disrespect of the original author. If you havenâ€™t already, Iâ€™d recommend looking into whatâ€™s going on before you watch the show. Decide for yourself before you decide to give your view to a corporate machine:)"
To much SJW crap in it. Pure trash.
"For those of you who can't see it, there are over 3 million dislikes of this video. I think that a lot of this has to do with the way that fans of this series are being treated by the media. They are being called ists even though they aren't bringing up race, culture, etc. I'm a communications student and that kind of behavior is uncalled for and just plain bad re publicity and advertising. Please stop before you make things worse."
"You can delete our dislikes and our comments, but you will never destroy our resolve. We love Tolkienâ€™s work, and we refuse to let you destroy it as you people have destroyed so many other great works. The buck stops with this."
You are the Shadow of Mordor.

Ownership by Amazon of rights to the LOTR IP is why we need limits on private property
"""We made a promise to ourselves at the beginning of the process that we weren't going to put any of our own politics, our own messages or our own themes into these movies. In a way, we were trying to make these films for him (Tolkien), not for ourselves."" - Peter Jackson"
Why do I have a feeling this is gonna suck.  Another franchise for Amazon to completely destroy with crappy writing and B movie talent.
I've already cancelled my Amazon prime account. No one spits on Tolkien's grave like this and gets away with it.
"there was no need for this to be LotR, could easily have been something different or inspired by- instead its become an insult to a legacy, a lost opportunity for a new story, and a blatant disregard for people who pay the most attention to the genre."
Boycot this show! Vote with your $. Vote with not giving viewership!
"Amazon deleted over half of the comments from this video! An honorable, respectable team behind this would not do such a thing. Amazon is trying to silence the voices of fans and non fans alike! We are real people
 Minorities aswell love Tolkien's work. We will fight back 10 folds more powerful and make a stand against all the evil and corruption from touching what is great and good!"
Deleting comments and hiding 3.076.074!!!!!!!!! dislikes will not help this abomination!
Remember to cancel your Amazon streaming subscriptions!!  Not sending them money sends the most powerful and effective message.
"It's ironic because Jackson made significant departures from the source material and even it's themes that Tolkien would not have approved of (and his son Christopher publicly stated his dislike for the Jackson films).  Yet these fans are conveniently ignoring that fact and act like this show which hasn't even been released yet is somehow the only adaptation that ""dishonoured"" Tolkien's works.  Seems a little disingenuous and there's something else at play here..."
"Â @Kyle DoucetteÂ  I don't mind small adaptations, and I was looking forward to this show, until I learned that unlike Jackson, they are not respecting Tolkien's world at all. When I watched Jackson's Trilogy, I felt the same world as when I read the book, even with a few controversial changes, it honored the story at large and the world of Tolkien, or so was his intent. The firing of the Tolkien Scholars on this production says it all."
Nobody cares.
Â @breadordecideÂ  Perfectly spoken like a true breadordenial
Â @breadordecideÂ  I do
Â @Camilo Fonseca ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡´Â  no u dont
Â @breadordecideÂ  LOL
I mean they sold it to amazon.
Â @breadordecideÂ  and amazon said in an early article that they promised to respect Tolkien's set parameters to his world. This was clearly a condition or Tolkien's son would not have given the okay.
"Also Peter: all the heroes are white and every bad thing is dark brown or black.
Great job peter! Stayed true to Tolkienâ€™s racist vision."
Iâ€™M sure amazon felt their wallet shake when they lost your 12 bucks.
Amen.
"Remove your payment info from your account, too.  When I cancelled mine, they tried to charge me again the following month."
"Â @breadordecideÂ  If you think I'm the only one who cares about Tolkien's legacy that much then you must not have much to shake. And it's not just 12 bucks, I do over a thousand a year easily on their site. Multiply that times a growing army of loyal fans and they will feel their foundations shake like from the march of the Ents on the warpath."
"Â @Thomas WrightÂ  Good to know, thanks, will remove mine as well."
"â€‹Â @Rachel BlackÂ  Exactly.A recent head of Disney, now retired said that they don't have to produce masterpieces, just product, because people will watch anyway. So far, they have been proven right. We have to show them the fans will not watch."

If you noticed the dislikes going down. Check to make sure your click is still a dislike. Amazon is paying google to change what you clicked .
111 k bots vs 1.4 M dislike fans . Hmmm... deleting comments again Amazon. How is is your deleteing dislikes ?
Dislike upvotes
cant wait to see this trash
Garbage
"1.6 million dislikes have been removed in the last 3 days. Around 50 thousand comments have also been removed. Not a good look, Amazon."
"44k comments on video with 29 million views...
Cool censorship, as i see you are really desperate."
This will be forever know as one of the worst flops. Came back because my comment was deleted . . . .
Patetic.
Lixooooo
our society can produce nothing new except in the realm of technology. All it can accomplish culturally is to pervert the works of healthier generations by imposing the prevailing ideology upon them.

Keep deleting Amazon we will be coming back to let's everyone know you messed up.
Evil cannot create only ..... comment deleted by Amazon
"So I have seen 101K/122K, then 105K/154K, now it's 111K/1.4MILLION!!! What a joke Amazon!"
"Ich habe die bÃ¶se Vorahnung und Hoffnung das ich mich tÃ¤usche, dass das groÃŸe Narrativ dieser Serie wirklich eine grÃ¤ÃŸliche SchÃ¤ndung der Literatur Tolkiens wird auf ideologischer und kÃ¼nstlerischer Ebene, um es drastisch zu sagen."
1.4m + dislikes. The truth always triumphs over evil intended lies.
They are not scare at all.
The mental gymnastics for these conspiracies lol.
"They keep deleting comments and downvotes. They think we won't come back and re-add our comments, and yes most won't, however some of us will. I will."
Â @TheOtherGuyÂ  enough will. You can't put a cherry on top of a turd pie and expect Tolkien fans to comply
Cry more about it
Â @Rachel BlackÂ  You dont know what ethics are hun.
Umm game of thrones was new and amazing.
"Â @breadordecideÂ  But, when Dan and Dave had to actually produce anything new, they failed miserably.

Amazon tried to produce something new with Wheel of Time, too, and failed miserably.

They will do the same with Rings of Power because they have purposes that are not creative, just divisive."
"Â @Matt WilsonÂ  Oh god the WoT...please don't mention it, it still gives me a headache thinking about how they utterly raped that epic series of books.  Utter trash.

I have to go bang my head against a wall now."
"Â @breadordecideÂ  I don't know about new, it aired what about 10-11 years ago and was based off of books from like the mid 90's. as far as Amazing..... yes right up to about season 6 or 7 when it fell off a cliff!"
Â @Anjelica SnorcketğŸ­Â  Its called an adaptation. Ya know like peter jacksons movies.
"Â @SS900FÂ  He said nothing new exists. GOT was new. And people loved it for a time. You
Dolts love peters LOTR movies and thats an adaptation. The thing you suddenly detest."
It was at 3 million dislikes a couple days ago
Â @GengarÂ  it was at ten billion thirty minutes ago.
"Hey youtube, heres another comment you can delete:
How much money did Amazon pay you to delete critical comments?"
dislike.
"With the dislikes removed, that took away one of the ways a viewer can express their thoughts about a video, which is good for you guys for your image, but apparently that wasn't enough for you guys!? You guys even DELETE COMMENTS? Tf is wrong with you all? Screw all of you.
Tangina nyo!"
"Cringe terrible, removing comments and down votes lmao maybe instead of hiding the problems maybe ask yourself why is this happening and fix your show...."
horrible
pathetic
Cringe.
How many thousands of comments will Amazon delete before they stop and realize the magnitude of their error?
Just made sure to re-dislike. You can't silence us.
These stories were written before television as your mind was to be the screen upon which the author weaves the visuals for you to imagine.  Stick with the books and read.

"Stop deleting comments, minions of Morgoth Bauglir!"
Yak
Amazon. You blatantly don't care about the story and the established world to fit in diverse characters in a logical way.  So we detest you.
Iâ€™ve never wanted a show to crash and burn more
"Canâ€™t wait for black panther 2, where half of the Africans are Japanese"
"something something cannot create anything you know the rest and you know it's true

"I mean, black panther had white characters in it."
Â @breadordecideÂ  I donâ€™t think you understand that the â€œwhite charactersâ€ roles were not that of the native African people. And it wouldnâ€™t make sense for them to be.
"Â @SayBiirdÂ  One white guy in black panther. So LOTR gets one black elf.
Fair trade."
"Â @breadordecideÂ  Lol youâ€™re not getting it dude. Itâ€™s not the fact thereâ€™s black actors in LOTR. Itâ€™s the fact that these black characters are portraying â€œwhiteâ€ characters. 

Does that make sense?

If black panther or any of his kindred in Wakanda were white, it wouldnâ€™t make sense. 

Now if thereâ€™s some black ethnic group that Tolkien wrote about, and are involved in the story he wrote then sure, but he didnâ€™t."
"Â @breadordecideÂ  You canâ€™t take someoneâ€™s creative work, and change it into something else. They (Tolkien in this case) had every right to describe and create his own world. Itâ€™s us as consumers, readers, or viewers that get to choose what we want. If you donâ€™t like LOTR the way it was written by the author, then go read one of the billion other books out there."
"Â @breadordecideÂ  And for the record elves can totally be black. Seriously. Hobbits, dwarves even gnomes can be black. BUT THEY ARENâ€™T ever described as black in TOLKIENâ€™S world. 

Do you get it?"
"â€‹Â @breadordecideÂ  Actually, the Panther had two white guys and you traded them for black Achilles and Anne Boleyn, so no black elfs. If you really want one, give us white Blade and white christian Cassius Clay. It's a fair price, take it or leave it."
Â @breadordecideÂ  They did have Gollum and Bilbo.  The Tolkien white guys.
Amazon got rid of the Tolkien quote everyone was putting in the comments
One evil corporation to ruin them all!
Trash. You are trashing this just like you trashed Wheel of Time. Fuâ‚¬k off.
"Hey Prime I see you deleted my comments along with thousands of others.. no worries, I helped you save sometime so I deleted my prime membership for you.

Stop deleting the dislikes Amazon it makes you feel more guilty
No respect
Disgraceful. And most of all DISGRACEFUL bruh. Smh sad to destroy the work of a legend with your politics and bs.

Middle-earth should reflect Middle-earth not our modern world. What are these people thinking?
It's kinda sad. Imagine if you gave some real Tolkien fans the budget Amazon has to work with. Imagine the masterpiece that could have been created.

Vai lÃ¡ no filme entÃ£o reclamar pedir pra colocar o expurgo do condado e mata o saruman como no livro... Isso foi diferente mas nÃ£o desrespeitou a Lore LOTR
Pedem respeito mas nem sabem como diversidade faz bem
"Â @Felipe WernerÂ  1Âº: as varias mudanÃ§as nos filmes do PJ foram por questÃµes tÃ©cnicas relacionadas com o ritmo e imersÃ£o para o estilo cinematogrÃ¡fico de adaptaÃ§Ã£o. Nenhuma dessas mudanÃ§as foram motivos de polÃ­ticas pessoais nem ideologias raciais ou de gÃ©neros, ao contrario do que essa serie estÃ¡ tentando forÃ§ar. Lugar de militancia polÃ­tica Ã© nos palcos politicos com a devida plateia e nÃ£o no entretenimento, atÃ© porque as pessoas esperam consumir esse mesmo entretenimento pra nÃ£o ter que aturar 24/24 os mesmos assuntos da vida diÃ¡ria.

Acredito que consegue discernir e raciocinar sobre isso e porquÃª as pessoas estÃ£o revoltadas com essas mudanÃ§as movidas por ideologias e Ã³dio contra o prÃ³prio autor ( entrevistas dos roteiristas ).

2Âº: ""diversidade faz bem"". Diversidade existe em tudo, atÃ© as pedras e plantas sÃ£o diversas, nÃ£o existe apenas um tipo de pedra. NÃ£o Ã© porque uma pessoa decide fazer algo baseado apenas num tipo de pedra que ele tem preconceito com as outras pedras. Se alguÃ©m quer historias sobre outros tipos de pedras, que se foquem nessas e ponto final... nÃ£o precisa ficar inventando problemas e falsas acusaÃ§Ãµes raciais.

Mas jÃ¡ que vc estÃ¡ tÃ£o preocupado com ""diversidade"" e o ""bem que faz"", vamos mais a fundo sobre os materiais originais da lore da Terra-Media, e visto que vc citou o penÃºltimo capitulo sobre o shire, posso deduzir que vc conhece a lore e sobre a diversidade existente.
Existem povos de outras etnias pela Terra-Media que, apesar de nÃ£o terem nenhuma narrativa construÃ­da em torno de personagens dessas regiÃµes, Tolkien deixou uma base construÃ­da sobre esses povos e deixando claro que esses povos tÃªm ligaÃ§Ã£o com Morgoth e Sauron, e que foram vitimas e manipulados por eles e pelos prÃ³prios Numenoreanos que eram brancos, e forÃ§ados durante milÃ©nios a lutarem pelas forÃ§as do mal, e provavelmente contra a vontade deles tanto que havia revoltas contra essa opressÃ£o com influÃªncias dos magos azuis.
Isso sim Ã© diversidade de verdade, Ã© natural, orgÃ¢nico e verdadeiro.

Imagine as narrativas e personagens de outras etnias que podiam ser criados pra retratar outras realidades sobre a Terra-Media, historias de lutas e resistÃªncias contra a opressÃ£o, as guerras civis entre aqueles que se recusavam a seguir as forÃ§as do mal. Imagine alguns dos NazgÃ»l serem retratados nessa serie com suas origens nessas regiÃµes igual ao KhamÃ»l o Easterling.
Contudo, essas outras etnias foram completamente ignoradas e descartadas pelos produtores da serie que preferiram fazer polÃ­ticas com argumentos falaciosos e ofendendo o autor.
A diversidade faz tanto bem como vc disse que desprezaram a diversidade orgÃ¢nica existente nos livros. Como vc explica isso ?
Tanto que tem fÃ£s pelo planeta reclamando e manifestando suas decepÃ§Ãµes por nÃ£o ter esses povos de outras etnias e com histÃ³rias nÃ£o contadas completamente ignoradas.

Se a Amaz0n nÃ£o fosse racista, ela nÃ£o ignorava nem desprezava esses povos como tem feito, e preferem despejar suas prÃ³prias culpas nos fÃ£s. Racismo Ã© atacar e mudar etnias jÃ¡ descritas no material original pra promover agendas raciais com pendores radicais.

Se vc questiona a fidelidade nos filmes do PJ citando os livros e se preocupa tanto com o ""bem da diversidade"", acredito que vc deveria ter alguma coisa de importante e construtivo a dizer sobre essas faltas de respeito da serie e seus produtores menosprezarem outras etnias dentro da prÃ³pria lore, a nÃ£o ser que pra vc essas etnias tambÃ©m sejam insignificantes."
"Â @Camilo Fonseca ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡´Â  a Ãºnica coisa que eu gostaria de ver e vou ver Ã© um conto do senhor dos anÃ©is, se Ã© com  branco ou negro, amarelo, moreno, Ã­ndio nÃ£o faz diferenÃ§a sÃ³ vamos ter novamente uma boa histÃ³ria sendo contada Ã© isso que os fÃ£s querem"
"Â @Felipe WernerÂ  vc estÃ¡ falando besteira, Tolkien Ã© inglÃªs e falou em cartas q seu sonho era escrever uma mitologia da Inglaterra. NÃ£o existe diversidade da mitologia NÃ³rdica, pq sÃ£o dos povos de origem Escandinava, NorueguÃªs, Dinamarquesa e Sueca, todos europeus clÃ¡ssicos. Assim como os ingleses. NÃ£o Ã© uma questÃ£o de diversidade, e sim de histÃ³rica,  o Mundo de Tolkien segue essa lÃ³gica, baseado nos ingleses. Ele descreveu a aparÃªncia das raÃ§as de lÃ¡, e mudar assim Ã© um desrespeito ao autor. NÃ£o tenho problema com diversidade, desde que nÃ£o seja uma deturpaÃ§Ã£o de uma cultura, seria melhor q se fizesse sÃ©ries sobe as mitologias dos povos negros da Ãfrica, tem muita mitologia legal. Ou poderiam criar um mundo, uma fantasia como esse diversidade, mas nÃ£o pegar uma obra e modificÃ¡-la para os tempos atuais.  Um exemplo tosco disso foi filme deuses do Egito, no qual sÃ³ colocaram brancos, poderiam ter seguido a histÃ³ria do Egito mesmo e lÃ¡ teve pessoas negras, pessoas pele oliva como os Ã¡rabes e brancos como romanos q misturaram lÃ¡. Havia uma diversidade verdadeira no Egito a depender da Ã©poca, sem contar q o deuses lÃ¡ tem cores variada como verde vermelho, azul, entre outras. Essa mudanÃ§a q nÃ£o respeita o criador da obra ou os fatos histÃ³ricos Ã© uma loucura."
"Â @Felipe WernerÂ  vc nÃ£o Ã© um fÃ£ de senhor dos anÃ©is, Ã© uma fanfarrÃ£o."
Exatamente!

Â @Gabriel FilletiÂ  Com certeza kkkk
"@Gabriel FilletiÂ  bom pelo seu argumento jÃ¡ vi que vc Ã© filho Ãºnico e que nÃ£o ouve e nem aceita a opiniÃ£o de outros, imaturo e agressivo ao dizer que uma pessoa ao se expressar estÃ¡ falando besteira. 
Obs: Sou fÃ£ mas isso nÃ£o significa que conheÃ"
Â @Giovani MenezesÂ  ao invÃ©s de vir contar algo tÃ£o supÃ©rfluo pq nÃ£o me passa os nÃºmeros da mega sena? Kkkkkkkkk
"Â @Felipe WernerÂ  Qual Ã© a lÃ³gica e o bom senso em mudar etnias de personagens ? NÃ£o faz nenhum sentido. Eu como angolano fico repugnado com essa estupidez, nÃ£o me representa em nada e elfos negros nÃ£o existem, nÃ£o representa em nada minha cultura e ancestralidade.
Isso nÃ£o se chama ""diversidade"" nem ""representatividade"", isso se chama preguiÃ§a criativa e panfletagem raciais e pouco representativos dos mitos da vida real, tanto europeus como africanoss. 
Se vc considera mudar etnias de negro pra branco, entÃ£o pela lÃ³gica do seu prÃ³prio pensamento, mudanÃ§as raciais sÃ£o erradas, portanto mudar de branco para preto deveria igualmente ser errado, caso contrario o seu argumento seria hipocrita pois entraria em contradiÃ§Ã£o.

E para concluir, o processo criativo de um livro fictÃ­cio, por mais que seja imaginÃ¡rio, ele precisa de regras, as vezes semelhantes ao nosso mundo real para justificar certas coisas e fazer sentido, pois isso aumenta a credibilidade e a imersÃ£o, e a compreensÃ£o desse mundo e das historias. Os tons de peles, entre outros aspetos tais como climas e migraÃ§Ãµes sÃ£o um dos exemplos Ã³bvios disso. ( se vc conhece a lore do senhor dos anÃ©is, vc vai dar conta que essas regras existem )

E eu como aspirante a escritor de alta fantasia posso lhe garantir que nÃ£o Ã© fÃ¡cil escrever historias, ainda mais num mundo secundÃ¡rio com vÃ¡rios mitos feitos de raiz e com as devidas inspiraÃ§Ãµes. Leva anos e Ã© extremamente desgastante. Eu ficaria ofendido se viesse um monte de pessoa egoÃ­sta e sem noÃ§Ã£o exigir, e ficar feliz em querer passar por cima dos meus anos de esforÃ§o criativo para forÃ§ar mudanÃ§as Ã©tnicas ou de gÃ©neros para agradar ideologias pessoais que em nada tÃªm a ver com a minha obra e meus contos."
"Â @Gabriel FilletiÂ  e mais, uma das motivaÃ§Ãµes dele, para alem das lÃ­nguas, foi ver que a Inglaterra nÃ£o tinha uma mitologia prÃ³pria, nada ao nÃ­vel dos panteÃµes gregos, nÃ³rdicos por exemplo. Se houve, foi apagado ou perdido com a chegada dos anglo-saxÃµes e depois dos vikings. 
Claro que Ã© um mundo paralelo e prÃ³prio, nÃ£o Ã© uma alegoria mas sim uma aplicaÃ§Ã£o de certos elementos e inspiraÃ§Ãµes como ele mesmo dizia. O que acontece na primeira, segunda e terceira Era seria um equivalente aplicado do que seria a antiga mitologia inglesa que nunca existiu na vida real. Mas esse simbolismo estÃ¡ aÃ­.
O problema Ã© que as pessoas nos dias atuais nÃ£o sabem o que significa bom senso e o que significa ter respeito. Pessoas sentem prazer em deturpar o esforÃ§o dos outros, passar por cima do trabalho de um autor porque acham piada mudar tudo.

E vc tem razÃ£o sobre o Egito. Eram um povo bem diverso em termos de tons de pele, com o sul tendo mais tonalidade escura por conta dos nubios, e norte mais claro por conta da posiÃ§Ã£o geogrÃ¡fica exposta a migraÃ§Ãµes vindas do mediterrÃ¢neo, da Anatolia e da penÃ­nsula arabica, e claro, dependendo do perÃ­odo histÃ³ricos visto que houveram ocupaÃ§Ãµes de gregos, romanos, nubios, depois assÃ­rios, etc etc, mas no entanto jÃ¡ vi pessoas forÃ§ando que o EgÃ­pcios eram todos negros subsaharianos, o que Ã© contraditÃ³rio e forÃ§ado contra os factos."
"Â @Felipe WernerÂ  ""AliÃ¡s MITOLOGIA foi a forma que a humanidade criou pra enfrentar seus problemas relacionado a existÃªncia e  compreensÃ£o do mundo com coisas inacreditÃ¡veis ""

Se vc tem noÃ§Ã£o disso sobre as mitologias criadas na vida real por povos diversos pelo mundo e ao longo de milÃ©nios, entÃ£o vc deveria igualmente ter dado conta que cada mitologia desses povos retratavas as figuras mitolÃ³gicas de acordo com aquilo que eles viam e as suas realidades. Os gregos nÃ£o imaginaram seus deuses como negros. Os deuses egÃ­pcios eram retratados semelhantes a animais que eles conheciam. Os deuses gregos e romanos eram semelhantes aos povos que os criou, e nÃ£o Ã  povos que nÃ£o tinham nada a ver com eles. 
Os folclores de mitos africanoos eram baseados na espiritualidade, nos espÃ­ritos ancestrais e na existÃªncia de um poder superior da natureza e do mundo dos espÃ­ritos, ou atÃ© mesmo da magia boa e das trevas. Ã‰ obvio que pensÃ¡vamos em nossos ancestrais negros, e nÃ£o brancos escandinavos, porque eram realidades diferentes. Cada mito aplica inspiraÃ§Ãµes do visual de seus criadores, portanto existe uma lÃ³gica a ser respeitada, senÃ£o fica algo genÃ©rico."

"Â @Camilo Fonseca ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡´Â   contÃ­nuo dizendo que isso Ã© intolerante da parte dos seus comentÃ¡rios... O que eu disse no termo mitologia foi que a humanidade quando nÃ£o encontrava uma lÃ³gica palpÃ¡vel para explicar determinado fato ela criava lenda, mitos e a junÃ§Ã£o disso tudo a mitologia... E vc estÃ¡ completamente errado que os povos antigos idealizava o formato dos deuses com algo que eles jÃ¡ viram TlÃ¡loc dos astecas Ã© puramente inventada pela mente humana, eu teria outros deuses e mitos pra descrever sÃ³ para mostrar a falta do seu conhecimento. 
Seria hipÃ³crita se eu estivesse criticando um ator branco em um personagem negro. Eu iria gostar de ver um leonardo dicaprio interpretando um filme completamente novo baseado na histÃ³ria de Ron Stallworth e no final da um plot twist sobre racismo estrutural.

Enfim nÃ£o dÃ¡ pra discutir com pessoas que nÃ£o entendem nem o bÃ¡sico do que estÃ£o defendendo.

Sou negro e me sinto satisfeito por ter personagens negros seja em filmes histÃ³ricos, mitolÃ³gicos ou scifi.

Vc tem noÃ§Ã£o que o conceito de negro, ou do inglÃªs dark ou black se refere Ã  personalidade, a essÃªncia e comportamento mais sombria e obscura desses seres e nÃ£o da pele ? Tanto que os elfos das trevas de Svartalfheim sÃ£o apenas elfos que muitas vezes associados com anÃµes pelos seus hÃ¡bitos e gostarem de viverem em lugares com pouca luz em debaixo da terra. Ambos elfos tÃªm a mesma fisionomia, o que muda e define o nome Ã© o comportamento, daÃ­ o nome dark/black, ou vc nÃ£o consegue entender esse raciocino bÃ¡sico ?

NÃ£o falei nenhuma intolerÃ¢ncia, falei factos histÃ³ricos que foram estudados e comprovados por dÃ©cadas, entre outros factos visÃ­veis a olho nu pra quem tem alguma capacidade de discernir as coisas como elas sÃ£o e nÃ£o como queremos que elas sejam para a nossa conveniÃªncia ideolÃ³gica.
Pode pesquisar que vai encontrar o meu que encontrei. NÃ£o existe nada que define elfos como africanos. Isso Ã© um autentico disparate, e vc ainda tem coragem de falar que as pessoas que pesquisam nÃ£o conseguem ""entender o bÃ¡sico"", sendo que nem o bÃ¡sico vc consegue mencionar como deve ser.

Vc se diz negro, entÃ£o se vc valoriza tanto sua pele, deveria valorizar suas raizes africannas e se informar mais sobre elas ao invÃ©s de aplaudir apropriaÃ§Ãµes e mudanÃ§as culturais."

If you don't like The Lord Of The Rings, go write your own novel with all the representation and diversity and identity politics you can possibly shoehorn in. But leave Tolkien's work alone!"
garbage
I find it totally wrong that the dislike counter is again artificially subtracted. Because I think fans have a right to have their say when the fandom they love is so thoroughly destroyed. Iâ€™ve been skeptical from the start that Amazon didnâ€™t know how to do this right and now every news that comes from this just proves better how right Iâ€™ve been all along. This is going to be a complete disaster from start to finish.

Deleting critical comments. Real classy Amazon!
"For people asking why the anger: Injecting activist agenda in a work of art and forcing it. If the ""creators"" of this show wanted to give voice and representation to other races and genders they could have started by adapting the works of N.K. Jemisin, Ben Okri, Tomi Adeyemi, Jordan Ifueko, Charles R. Saunders or so many others. For years Saunders was trying to get an adaptation for Imaro. They could have started with that instead of ""stealing"" Tolkien's work. Now Saunders is sadly dead and his work is finally getting an adaptation, but if these amazon ""creators"" would have started with Imaro instead of ""reimagining"" a piece of art that doesn't need reimagining, Saunders would had been able to watch his adaptation and the so called ""representation"" would had been there years or decades ago. That's why the fandom is mad. They are injecting political views in a piece of art when they could have created a new story or adapted so many others. 
I also think the audience is mad after seeing what has happened to other stories like Star Wars, He-Man, etc. They are transforming someone else's art in their political marketing. As for princess-warrior Galadriel, warrior women have existed since humans exist, that's not a discovery or invention of present-day female producers or female studies ""specialists"". In fiction, Anime and manga have given us amazing female warriors for decades. Also a lot of sci-fi works (here's looking at you Ripley). The weird thing is that nowadays the only female characters they can create are Mary Sues (Rey ""whatever is her last name"") or masculine women. Hayao Miyazaki created amazing heroines and they don't need to look like He-Man or behave like Conan ir order to be strong, brave and smart. If it has a point for the story and the character's arc, so be it (we all love Brienne of Tarth) but one has to wonder why they are trying to force the idea that strong women can ONLY look like a male bodybuilder or any other male archetype."

"Itâ€™s not racist to desire a rich connection with your culture and country.

Also, If one believes that girls who are not black canâ€™t wear hoop earrings, because itâ€™s cultural appropriation and actors canâ€™t play people of other racial backgrounds, isnâ€™t it hypocritical to then want an english writer to write about other cultures that are not even his experience? It is a writers rule to, â€œwrite what you know.â€ Should the Greek and Roman gods change their races? Should we repaint and re-sculpt their sculptures, because they represent their own culture? That is absurd. If someone is so entitled that they must be represented every second, they are both selfish, as not everyone can be represented all the time, and they are narcissistic, if they cannot empathize with the experience of others who are not exactly like them."

Tolkien went through war and writing the LOTR helped him work through a lot of what he experienced. . . It is a story of great turmoil, sorrow, and great bravery and beauty in it's midst. It isn't game of thrones, as game of thrones is about a fight for power, and Tolkien's world is about the little man, and small acts of kindness being the great power that overcomes evil."

"I don't need my ethnicity in LOTR to find representation.

We find representation when we like Gimli and Legalos NO LONGER CARE about SHALLOW, outward differences and embrace the experience of standing with one another as friends no matter what. If someone doesn't feel represented in this story  and can not connect to the characters, that says everything about their lack of inner character, depth and lack of love for the LOTR."

"Â @breadordecideÂ  Everyone rightfully complained when the Avatar movie casted white actors to play Asian Characters. How is this any different? The race thing is just one part of the larger problem, that being the writers are going to put their politics over story telling. I highly doubt anyone in this was casted because they where just such great actors they simply had to be in it. If they wanted multicultural exclusivity in their fantasy work then they could have made up one. Why can't Hollywood make a completely new property? Maybe even one based on African culture? Or hell just tell some true stories? Its because they don't actually care about inclusivity and only see people as demographics. If they cared they wouldn't censor their movies over seas, they'd have balls and pick a side, message or money. They won't make something new because then they would be taking a risk on something not guaranteed to at least break even. Hollywood hates anything risky and not promise to succeed. Their mindset is anti creativity and anti creativity is anti art. Hollywood has been bankrupt on ideas for over a decade now and have been inbreeding the same things over and over again. That is why Jurassic Park, Terminator, Star Trek so on are shells of their former selves that actively go against the morals thought in the first place. This show is only being made because LOTR already exist and has a built in audience and this requires no actual work. Fact is these kinds of writers do this because they CANNOT create anything that connects to people or isn't immediately dated. They can't and NEVER WILL be able to make art, they can only make products. If they actually had souls I'd feel sorry for them. That is what this is. A defective product that is now leeched onto something beloved. Something made by an artist."
Â @Tuomas HuuhtanenÂ  And the setting is middle earth. Its not Europe and its not based on any real history. Fictional. Fictional. Not real.
"Â @breadordecideÂ  Of course it's fictional. And yes, you are right, it is not based on real history, but let me quote Tolkien himself:

""I am historically minded. Middle-earth is not an imaginary world. ... The theatre of my tale is this earth, the one in which we now live, but the historical period is imaginary. The essentials of that abiding place are all there (at any rate for inhabitants of N.W. Europe), so naturally it feels familiar, even if a little glorified by enchantment of distance in time.""

That is the setting he created: A mythological past of Europe, Britain in particular. It may not be what you want it to be, but that is what it is. Even if it is fictional, fictional worlds have rules you just can't alter as you please without changing it's nature."
Â @Tuomas HuuhtanenÂ  Thats no excuse for why elves are only white and there isnâ€™t a single black human. â€œWhite onlyâ€ doesnâ€™t sound like a fiction rule as much as it sounds like white supremacy.
"Â @breadordecideÂ  â€‹  First you say how Middle-Earth is completely imaginary and not supposed to represent pre-historic Europe, and after showing a quote from the author, you say it's just an excuse for white supremacy. Goalposts keeps moving. Besides, every disagreement is white supremacy to you, I even saw you suggesting a brown woman to be misogynist white power enthusiast here.

If the setting does not support multicultural casting it doesn't make it racist. 1001 Nights is not racist even when most of the cast would require Arab and other Middle-Eastern hires, if the purpose is authenticity and 100 % respect for the people who created it. It's not an excuse to keep Native Americans out of some Arab ethno fantasy as your logic would suggest, it's just how the bloody world and setting is written. If they'd cast randomly multicultural people in a modern sense, a blue-eyed blonde Norwegian as Sinbad as an example, I couldn't watch it without thinking how silly the whole adaptation is. It would need to be exceptionally good for it to not bother me a bit.

Yeah, sometimes it's whites only/mostly, sometimes blacks only/mostly, sometimes only asian men, sometimes women, sometimes gays, sometimes sideshow freaks et cetera, it all depends on a context of a story. The whole white supremacy accusations you so eagerly give are complete bull and may even be counter productive to your cause. It gives you an image of being an out of touch fanatic and makes perfectly reasonable people more vocal in opposing your position. You are in fact making your opposition more diverse than the diversity you are trying to promote, and I think you should do better."
i am wiser now than i was before reading this comment
Â @Tuomas HuuhtanenÂ  He has as much respect for Tolkien as these Amazon clowns.
Â @breadordecideÂ  That's your opinion. LOTR was written before diversity as we know it today existed in the modern West.
Â @breadordecideÂ  the author of the fictional universe said that all elves are only white. thats the reason why elves are only white. do you have a problem with that?
"Â @breadordecideÂ  There are black humans in Middle-earth, they are from the South, from Harad, if they want to represent skin colour diversity in Middle-earth, then they could have done that properly in a way that makes sense. Now as for black dwarves, i don't think Tolkien ever mentioned what the other dwarf clans looked like from the far east, so that's fair.
As for the elves, personally i don't know, i am more concerned about Elrond and Galadriel looking like kids while they were still thousands of years old at this time, they should look almost the same as in the LotR films."
Â @breadordecideÂ  Im pilipino and most of the shows in my country shows Pilipino actors. DOES THAT MEAN WERE RACIST FOR NOT SHOWCASING ETHNICITY OUTSIDE OF OUR OWN? No. This is Tolkiens imaginary of what Europe would be if it had myths. He specifically said he wanted to create a mythology for his country since it doesnâ€™t have one. This is him representing his own country. For you to litter it with ethnic garbage outside of Europe is an insult to his work.
"â€‹Â @Stara NdeathÂ  For you to start spewing nonsense about someone you clearly don't have the first clue about is also a filipino.. erm sorry.. pilipino thing, isn't it? 

In Middle Earth we have the Avari, or Dark Elves. They are as dark as black people are today. People accusing Tolkien of racism should try to pick up a book once in a while. 

So including a black actor as an elf is pretty normal for the world they are in. Tolkien included them, why can't Amazon do that? 

But then again, one can discuss if the writers KNEW of the Avari in the first place, or they just felt like being inclusive and have a black man play an elf. That is another story."
"Well put, Laura"
"Â @breadordecideÂ  Because the original works were created by and for English people. It's a ""what would English folklore and mythology be, if it wasn't bastardised by Norman influence""."
Very well said.
If You don't care why You complaning so much?
Amen! Well said.
Â @Michael VedalÂ ...No they aren't. Avari elves do not have brown skin lol quit pretending you have even the slightest clue of what you are talking about.
I'm Turkish and Caribbean and I've never really cared about the race of the characters at all. I know allot of it is based on Norse mythology. It's the way the characters are written that gripped me not the representation. Aragorn is the character i love and relate to the most and not because we look anything alike.
Â @breadordecideÂ  Wrong. It is based on Europe and Tolkien wrote it as a mythos for the world.
hush. lets the blue haired white woman that hates LOTR speak for you lol.
Â @blue sparkÂ  i think the issue was they cast bad actors. and directors. and kraft services. and janitors. and ect. avatar is a bad example its just bad lol.
"Cool story, but how the heck did you get all of that from this teaser?"
BRAVO BRAVO!!!
"Â @Michael VedalÂ  the Avari are not called dark cause they have black skin. They are called Mordi-quendi, because they were to scared to make the voyage west into Aman or lands undying. 
They are called dark elves because they never saw the light of the two Trees, in the time before the Sun and the Moon. Also they are called dark because unlike the Vanyar, Noldor, and some Teleri, they werenâ€™t illuminated in deeper knowledge of Ea by the Ainur. 
-a black guy"
Â @Per 1Â  There's a ton of information available about this show outside of this trailer.
"fells good to read stuff like this, thanks."
"Â @breadordecideÂ  Homie if you think middle earth isn't supposed to be prehistoric Europe then you clearly never read the books, Tolkien wrote LOTR as a new mythology for his people, the British people,  since there are very few surviving Anglo Saxon and Briton myths (aside from Beowulf). Middle earth was created as a replacement for those lost myths, and he deliberately states that middle earth is in our worlds ancient past, set in what would now be northern Europe, and Eru Illuvitar is literally the christian god... Also Tolkien gives a pretty clear description of what the people of his world look like..."
"Â @Michael VedalÂ  Dude, the dark elves were not called dark elves because of their skin color... you cannot fathom how hard you just made me facepalm lol"
Â @Valek ZÂ  <3
"Thank you for standing up for us & what is right, in the midst of our cultural erasure. We are all human, and being white is not a crime, erasing our stories and culture should not be socially acceptable, yet it is."
"Â @blue sparkÂ  why are you assuming anything about these actors abilities? Have you seen any of these actors work previously and dislikes their performance? You're basing the fact that you aren't going to enjoy their character and their performance on the fact that their race is distracting to YOU. That's your problem, buddy. Trailers can be bad, almost nothing about the plot has been released yet. Y'all are just big mad because they had the audacity to cast someone other than white actors, and yeah, that probably isn't keeping exactly in line with Tolkien's original vision, but newsflash, not everything has to be an exact recreation of the original and an audience in 2022 won't react the same as an audience in 1940."
Â @Morningstar Veggie PattyÂ  <3
Mhm.
Chapter and Verse please
Â @Elle753Â  all the enemies are south asian soldiers who are brown. All the heroes are white. Sooooo yeah.
"Â @breadordecideÂ  That is so incredibly reductionist. The main villain is obviously Sauron and his corrupted Orcs and Trolls, yes there are easterlings that appear as enemies of Anglo-saxon named characters. They are not evil because they are dark skinned, those individuals are evil because they abandoned their kin to follow Sauron as did Grima Wormtongue, Sauroman, the Lich kings, Eomer's father... It is not a story of white vs black but Good vs Evil and Good is certainly not a synonym for white skin in his works. Furthermore, the only reason we see evil Easterlings is because the story is centred on North western middle earth. I'd bloody love a story of the easterlings in their own country alongside the blue wizards and the trepidations they'd face"
"â€‹Â @breadordecideÂ  lol. Did you read the Silmarillion and the Unfinished Tales ? 
The Easterlings were forced to fight against the elves and Edain in the First Age, and not all of them were evil. Some just followed orders, and some were against Morgoth, ex: BÃ³r the Faithful and his sons. 
In the Second Age, Sauron dominated them and made them fight for him for centuries, and once again, not all wanted to follow him, with the blue wizards contributing to this resistance. 

The Haradrim had a similar background. They lived in peace in the south, had good relationship with Numenoreans until those were internally corrupted, betrayed and enslaved the Haradrims several years before Sauron was captured and brought to Numenor. After all this they were forced to fight against Gondor and later on alongside Sauron during the Third Age.


They were forced to do evil,  they were not evil by nature, they're actually victims from people's greed and arrogance. The most evil people in the stories are coincidently white: Feanor and his sons, Saruman the White, Ar-Pharazon and most of the numenoreans, orcs were elves (white) tortured and mutilated by Melkor.
Even Gondor had internal problems and a civil war, elves had internal problems, so... the narrative it's not about skin colours, it's about good vs evil; good people vs bad people... and to say that brown people in Middle-earth are evil because of racial reasons is ignorance and a lack of textual interpretation at the very least. And the fact that there is no narrative centered on a black character is not synonymous with racism.

This series had a lot of space and opportunities to create these narratives and fill the gap, but instead they disdained black people within the canon. The real racism comes from the producers of this serie."

"Â @breadordecideÂ  maybe, just maybe they are real people. The same people in the comments who say their ğŸ‘ was removed...which is more than a few."
Â @breadordecideÂ  so you're saying you are lying online to support a conspiracy?

"Â @breadordecideÂ  the likes have not decreased. The likes have slowly gone up. They were at 104 or a hund and and six for a while then jumped a few thousand, then 110,000 for a while and now 111,000. They aren't going down. Why would you lie you ask? I would ask, why should I assume your honesty over people in the comments?  You have more investment regarding this shows future than they do."
Â @breadordecideÂ  and obviously you do give a crap because you seem to want to drive your point home both here and all over the comment section both when it went higher the first time and was deleted and now.

"Injecting political agenda in a work of art. If they really wanted to give voice and representation to other races and genders they could have started by adapting the works of N.K. Jemisin, Ben Okri, Tomi Adeyemi, Jordan Ifueko, Charles R. Saunders or so many others. For yearsÂ (decades) Saunders was trying to get an adaptation for Imaro. They could have started with that instead of stealing Tolkien's work. Now Saunders is sadly dead and his work is finally getting an adaptation, but if these amazon ""creators"" would have started with Imaro instead of ""reimagining"" a piece of art that doesn't need reimagining, Saunders would had been able to watch his adaptation and the so called ""representation"" would had been there years or decades ago. That's why the fandom is mad. They are injecting political views in a piece of art when they could have created a new story or adapted so many others.Â 
I also think the audience is mad after seeing what happened to other stories like Star Wars, He-Man, etc. They are transforming someone else's art in their political marketing."

"YT can delete all the comments and dislikes, and it wonâ€™t change one immutable fact. Nothing Iâ€™ve seen in Rings of Power respects, nor will never equal or surpass, the magnificent mythology created by J. R. R. Tolkien."
Removing dislikes and comments isn't going to save you're P.O.S. show.
Stop removing comments and dislikes. I dislike it again you clowns
"Deleting comments and dislikes won't help, you lunatics. FU, Bezos."
"And just like that, 1.6 million dislikes evaporate."
"Odd. Last I checked, you had 3 million dislikes. How did you go from that to 1.4 M?"
"You messed with the wrong people, merchants."
"Stop deleting comments and dislikes, you vile rotten soulless spawn of evil."
amazon has deleted comments and dislikes.  Such a democratic response from them :D
You cannot silence the fans! Everyone knows this is absolute garbage!
"Removing the dislike bar doesn't change how everyone feels, just cancel it"
"I'm not a ""bot"" and had to dislike again. Why was MY dislike deleted?"
"Removing dislikes, removing comments. How sad you must be. Just own it, this is a dead on arrival show."
Hahahaha deleting comments and dislikes!
Dislike ğŸ‘
"Y'know, if you scroll down a bit, it does seem like they are only deleting that one mistaken quote that everyone was posting a few weeks back.  I'm the last person to defend Amazon, but they seem to be leaving up QUITE a bit of negativity and only getting rid of that.  I'm not sure this is the censorship hill to die on."
The actual dislike count is over 3 million.
"There were over 3million dislikes for this video, where did they go? This trailer looks awful... make something shitty if you must, just don't use the lord of the rings title"
"Streisand Effect, the more you try to hide something, more attention you draw to it.
If you are, or know anyone with a lot of followers on YouTube, PLEASE talk about this in your videos!  No one should be able to delete our Votes!   As of 04/13/22 with 1.4M Down Votes"
Embarrassing. Iâ€™m embarrassed for whoever put this crap together
So much drama over black characters and women. Stop gatekeeping minorities from franchises. Get over it.
"Â @yellomelloÂ  Ah yes the usual ""it's not representing enough people"" argument.
The drama IS NOT because the characters are black.
It's because amazon is destroying and disrespecting the old books by changing the lore.
If the series was pretty much 90% black and people started swapping races in it, then you'd be yelling how rasict and disrespectful the director is.
The fact is that Tolkien wrote this book about European mythology and that's why most of the characters and races are white.
You might not like it but it makes sense that most characters are white 
They could bring in some more characters from the south, which are said to be dark skinned.
But that would require creativity, and the progressive directors lack that.

TLDR Instead of fitting progressive thoughts to suit the story and lore, the directors are fitting the story to the progressive thoughts, disrespecting the lore and hiding by calling everyone who disagrees racist."
That app is broken. Channels cannot remove dislikes.
"They are deleting comments Indiscrininately,  from oldest to newest. I've seen it drop a thousand in an hour. People have complained about their comments that weren't the quote being deleted. They go for the most popular and older ones first."
"They are overwhelmed by negative comments ... And are speaking with YouTube on. How to silence both ""spammers"" and ""trolls"""
"Â @Queen BeruthielÂ  ah Beruthiel, I don't know if it's safe to use the c word here... But the original poster did and didn't have any probs. Hard to say, but your comment got poofed. I can only see it in notifications."
"Â @Queen BeruthielÂ  Queen Beruthiel's invisible comment: ""They don't ""c-sor"" or delete certain comments (ahem the real and the paraphrased quotes). They delete random comments, especially the oldest and most liked comments. They s1lence everyone."""
"Â @Queen BeruthielÂ  yep it is in invisible. If you sign out you will see it's not there, but it shows up as a number of replies on the main comment...so it's not removed just invisible to everyone but you...the sneaky way YouTube tries to silence you hoping u will not know. I commonly check with two disconnected devices if I suspect mine might be."
"Â @Queen BeruthielÂ  funny enough, you last comment went through. Go figure......."
My dislike is baacckkkkkkk Amazon.
44350 comments now. A few minutes ago it was 44380. A little earlier it was over 45k;
why will you kill this masterpiece ???
Removing dislikes and comments is pathetic
My comment was deleted where I said this trailer sucks. Wow.
"No matter how many comments and dislikes you remove, We will always remember what you did to Tolkien's legacy. Never forget, Never forgive."
It seems theyâ€™ve removed all the Tolkien quotes off aswel lol
"This show will crash and Burns, get fucked Amazon ğŸ–•"
Just a reminder that this trailer has 111k likes to 1.4M dislikes. You're welcome
Bet more than Half of the 3 million dislikes will still watch it.ğŸ™„
Dislike
"A twisted thing was brought fort.
A bleak and disingenuous adaptation, that both ridiculous and misinterprets the hearts of source and fandom.
It justifies itself on thinly built stools; 
prideful, contradictory, full of venom."
Stop removing my dislike!
I'm pretty sure there were more comments on this trailer? Hmm... Interesting
More 3.000.000 ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘
ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘
looks like ya'll f*cked with the wrong fandom
i finaly got around to visiting this absurd adaptation. I won't bother watching the trailer as I have seen the reviews and adds and have seen enough to know I don't want to dignify this with much watch time if any at all. But the comment section has some true entertainment value in it. If nothing else we can thank amazon for showing the world that there is one franchise not to be messed with.
it's no enough to dislike this trailer. you need to come back and make sure you dislike this trailer (every week)
Disliked. Don't you dare remove it. Sheep Lives Matter!
We are at 44320 now. There is another Shitstorm brewing for amazon
Â @CFNightmareÂ  No its youtube getting rid of bot commentsğŸ¤¨
Â @CoyoteÂ   They are getting rid of people's personal comments as well as people's posting of the quote. They are deleting people's dislikes. People in the comments have come back to find their dislike removed.
Â @Lil FishÂ  Maybe the anti bot algorithm mistakenly took out legit comments and dislikes. I donâ€™t think this is deliberate at all
Â @CoyoteÂ  them calling us and Tolkien racist is deliberate.  Shadow banning specific replies is deliberate. Releasing this on the day Tolkien's life ended is deliberate.
Â @Lil FishÂ  Ye ye ye but the issue was deleted comments/dislikes lol
Â @CoyoteÂ  but the issue is the same: dishonesty and trying to cover their a$$ets for their poor behavior.
So what did they do to Tolkien's legacy that was so bad?
Â @Michael VedalÂ  nothing yet. Some people think a black Elf or beardless Dwarf would make Tolkien turn over in his grave.
â€‹Â @Michael VedalÂ  They ('the writers'') are putting 'The Message' ahead of the story....
"Â @ReekÂ  Hmm... What about a black, beardless elf?"
"Â @ReekÂ  Again, that isnt it. You have to pay more attention before you talk and look ignorant"
"Â @ReekÂ  And yes, as stated by tolkien before he would roll in his grave for that"
Is this the mantra of basement dwellers? Seems weird that people will invest all of their mental well-being on entertainment.
Â @crimsn80Â  Invest all their mental well being? People arent that weak
Â @crimsn80Â  lol you haven't seen the anime community
"Partly agree, forgiving is christian, therefore Tolkien would really want us to forgive. But some may confuse forgiving with ""acting as if it never happened"", and that's of course ridiculous. It's also said ""be wise as serpents"". We remember what happened. It informs our decisions for the future. We don't have to put up with everything that's continuing to go on. In my mind Amazon should give an apology to the fans about what they did (censorship etc), reconsider and start over in their communication efforts, and be respectful this time around. Then they'll get respect back."
Â @AE3587Â  what is the issue can you expand?
"Â @Charley BrewsterÂ  I am very much against M SHE U but I don't judge trailers/teaser because I don't see any message in them( except maybe mrs Marvel) but what is message here exactly? I am blind maybe, lol."
"Â @ReekÂ  alright.. lets make a black panther film with the protagonist being white with long blonde hair screaming wakanda forever then. wouldnt that bother you at all?? and its not just about the races and the dwarf queen, its about changing galadriel to a mere warrior, its about using troll cgi, its about not honoring the books AT ALL storywise, its about so so so much more than just that. people just point that out because its the most obvious example of them not doing lord of the rings but lord of the progressive politics and representers. if you're cool with that then fine. but lord of the rings is based on books. masterpieces actually. By using a really silly example, imagine you read a book about a story of a pineapple tree that you love and connect to, and millions of people do so with you, tons of oscars awarded and basically its a hall of fame book-movie, but then they give you a movie about a bush that doesnt even have a pineapple seed nearby it in the movie. do you get it now why millions are pissed and why the video has millions of dislikes and all the comments are bashing it?"
"â€‹Â @JoeySkate24Â  Dude, it's entertainment. As an avid fan of the books, the films, and the extended lore myself, I accept that it is entertainment, and at the end of the day the producers are going to want to reach a mass audience. If inclusivity and progressive politics is their interpretation of what might sell, then cool. If some people get to see fictional, fantasy characters that might actually look like them and they appreciate that, then cool. If you do not like the direction they are taking this series with their own stories, then cool, that's you and probably a good number of fans. But at the end of the day, it is entertainment, and you can choose to partake in or abstain from said entertainment. Allowing yourself to be enraged by a 1 minute teaser trailer with a few characters that look different from how you want them to look is entirely on you for seeing it that way and getting yourself worked up. If you don't like it then don't consume said entertainment, bam, problem solved."
What exactly will you remember months before the show has even premiered?
What did they do to ruin tolkiens legacy exactly
Â @A Common ManÂ  Pay attention and maybe you'll see.
"they didn't remove the dislikes, have u been living in a hole? Youtube has done that"
â€œLook how the massacred my boy.â€
Â @A Common ManÂ  They added black people in it. This enrages the Trumpkins very much.
Â @Michael VedalÂ  if this is real i hope that next king of Wakanda will be white and redhead
Â @Alex LeaudÂ  It's not necessary to shoehorn diversity into EVERYTHING... Especially when it doesn't fit into the story
they are constantly removing comment. Check the comment number now. Give a few minutes and refresh the page. I did a few times and the number is coming down.
"Not just the quotes. All comments, from older to newer or most popular."
just a reminder it was more than 3 million dislikes and theu are deleting comments.
Â @Mustavo GaiaÂ  Whelp. Time restore the order again. pushes dislike on video
"As long as you don't pay for it, why not?"
No.
"I won't. I've seen what political and faux social messaging does to my entertainment. But by all means please do continue to consume this utter garbage. 

This time it'll be different... right?"
I don't want this trash in my mind when I think of lord of the rings. I'll watch it fail from afar and laugh as it burns.
I don't think you realize at how much of a visceral level we all want to see this destroyed. We don't see any appeal in this trash.
Â @Finrod FelagundÂ  they just deleted or shadow banned all the most recent comments
"Â @Finrod FelagundÂ  yeah, they are working their way forward... They take the top comments the oldest and most popular first."
Beautiful. I hope you saved this.
Several people did say they wished they could dislike it more than once; this fulfills their wishes at least.
ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¯
"Every time my comment gets removed , I will put it back."
"Where is the dwarf beard, Amazon? WHERE IS THE BEARD???"
funny how they keep tampering with the dislikes lol
"I always imagine The Author would be gracious yet firm about this interpretation of his literary legacy and let you know, using his impeccable verbiage, that you have tenaciously curdled the extractions of the sacred cow."
1.5 Million Dislikes!!
"Check the comments numbers, Youtube out here deleting comments"
"I love R2-D2, he's my favorite!"
Wiping over 1.6 million dislikes will not silence us. You are now being exposed even more for not caring about Tolkien's work.
another 400 000 Dislikes removed ! i dislike again !
Crap movie from the left...what do you expect?  They cant create!!!!
Kill it with fire
Hey Amazon. Your shitty adaption is shitty because you don't respect Tolkien enough to work WITHIN the established world to introduce diverse characters.
a piece of crap
THISS BUUULLL CRAP SHALL NOT PASSS!
Mass deleting comments like crazy... ğŸ˜®ğŸ˜®
"Havent you ever wondered.... how to destroy a beloved story that millions of people love...... oh i have an idea.
Lets change everything for the worst and then yell at the real fans for being racist. Stupid dipshits."
oh dear. this looks like garbage
The number of dislikes on this video went from 3.1M to 1.4M over night... Sus
Yes! LORD OF THE VIRTUE SIGNALING! Gonna be so awesome! ğŸ™„
Wow. Dislikes are being removed (eventhough we can't see them)
Amazon and YT still removing comments and dislikes.
In fact there are sme printscreens showing 3 million dislikes.
"Â @Mustavo GaiaÂ  That is true.  My guess is, so many people were saying, ""I wish I could dislike this more than once,"" so YT is obliging them."
Â @Thomas WrightÂ  ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
"it's more like shadowban, not strictly deleting"
"Â @Kacper GrzybowskiÂ  both. Comments are still counted that are shadow banned. When my comments here are shadow banned I can see them but no one else can. When they are deleted, I don't see them either. I have experienced both."
St the same time thru are puring comments. The last large purge was both comments and dislikes at the same time as well. Hardly seems a coincidence.
"I've seen enough of this show in this trailer to have an idea of what it's going to be like and where the motivations come from (which is clearly nothing Tolkien or his son would have ever allowed). I won't be watching it and I highly suggest you don't either.  But if you do end up watching it, please don't try to defend it as being good just because it's called Lord of the Rings. That's what they want you to do. That's what people like this always do. They capitalize on established brands because their own original works get zero traction because the quality of their work is extremely sub-par and they just rely on fancy visual effects and lowest-common-denominator writing distractions. There won't be anything deep or meaningful here you're just going to go ""Ohhh look at that move did you see that?!"" And sure LOTR had those too, but it was a bonus not the main content. The framework of what was underneath was solid and timeless. If you defend their work, you will be their only defence. Be extremely sure they deserve that before championing them."
1.6 million dislikes removed eh? It's gonna be such a disaster.
So stunning and brave.
"The lord of the rings environment is completely white because middle earth isnâ€™t that big, so almost everyone is one color. (Our skin color adapts to how hot our environment is). I know this is just some cash grab, low quality, embarrassment. J.r token was the only one who can do it right, not other people. Itâ€™s literally his world that he created, no wonder this already looks nothing like lord of the rings."
There are no dislikes in Be Sing Se
"â€œIt felt only natural to us that an adaptation of Tolkienâ€™s work would reflect what the world actually looks like.â€ 

- Lindsey Weber, E.P. Amazon's LOTR Series, Vanity Fair (Feb. 2022)



""There are certainly themes Tolkien felt were important. We made a promise to ourselves at the beginning of the process that we weren't going to put any of our own politics, our own messages or our own themes into these movies. What we were trying to do was to analyse what was important to Tolkien and to try to honour that. In a way, were trying to make these films for him, not for ourselves."" 

- Peter Jackson, Interview with GreenCine (Dec. 2002)"
removed 30K comments and 1.6 million dislikes.  what are they hiding?
"I want to be upfront with this comment: I wasn't into The Lord of the Rings when I first heard about this upcoming show. I didn't get into the Peter Jackson movies nor the original novels. However, because I heard of this series, one good thing has come out of it, I am investing in LOTR's now. Downloaded the audio book version of: The Fellowship of the Ring and have a physical copy of the novel coming my way, plan on watching the movies this weekend. Not because of your show, not how much money or promotion you've poured into this new thing, but because of the love people have shown for the orignal books and the Jackson movies. 

You are wasting money on this project, one that I will not watch because it is a prequel that has implications for future changes to existing lore once further rights are acquired. You can keep your fan fiction, I will keep to the original works. I do not begrudge you the right to waste your money on this project, it's just a drop in the bucket of Amazon's cofers. What I do care about though, what I do dislike, is you removing the dislikes and deleting comments from this trailer.

If you are afraid of people stating how they really feel, then it's within your power to disable comments, but you won't because it looks bad for optics. Instead, the dislikes will be erased, can't see them anyway without an extention; and the comments deleted a little at a time until nothing but praise is left for airtime. That is dishonest and shows you lack confidence in your work if you erase your critics."
Muito ruim!
Cut off 1 dislike 3 more take its place
"Yeah, keep deleting those dislikes and comments Amazon! The real fans of JRR Tolkien and his world know what youâ€™re doing and itâ€™s not working! Weâ€™re not as stupid as you think!ğŸ–•ğŸ»"
ÃSH KHAKFÃŠ AI-D DUR-RUGNU
Is Amazon/Youtube really erasing downvotes so it didnt surpassed the million mark by much? Apparently they went from 3M to 1M.
What is this abomination? I did not even know this was based on Tolkien's work because nothing on this trailer reminds me of Tolkien.
Nice trailer I'm go smash Feral now bye.
"Remember guys theres a chrome youtube dislike extension, where u can see back the dislikes, and in this video IS AMAZING"
"The use of actual relevant content from the books to point out the failings of this production would surely make the old professor smile.
A world so well made it contains dialogue that can be used to defend itself against corruption."
29M Views and only 111K likes. What a pathetic piece of garbage show
Ruining my childhood
Amazon WHY. The chance to create something beautiful and THIS......THIS is what you make. Smh bruh
Definitely brave to try and rewrite and burn the works of a genius and the father of fantasy... ğŸ˜¬ğŸ˜¬ğŸ˜¬
Â @Lil FishÂ  Indeed
How the times have changed. But they can be changed again. Great quote from Peter Jackson!
"Those quotes are the reason why lotr is a success, and why the Amazon show is not"
And people think that Tolkien were he alive would have liked or approved of Jackson's adaptations (yes all of them)? Not sure why people are portraying the Jackson adaptations as being more faithful when we haven't even seen this series.
"How strange of Amazon then: If they want something thatâ€™s reflecting the day and age weâ€™re living in - then why choose a piece of literature that was made 75 years ago, depicting a medieval time inspired from Keltic and Nordic roots, 500 years ago,.. 

By all means, make movies with all genders and â€œraceâ€, with people all over the world. But donâ€™t make it â€œpoliticalâ€. What makes a movie good is if thereâ€™s a good story to be told to begin with, regardless of who it revolves around. Thatâ€™s what movie business (which it sadly has turned into) has forgotten. Itâ€™s about the story, not politics,.."
"Â @Kyle DoucetteÂ  You need to stop going around spreading lies and discord among the true Fans, go back to the darkness and believe what you like, but do not pass on your views to the true Believers."
Â @The AssemblerÂ  now what quantifies someone as a â€œtrue believerâ€?
"Oh, they've deleted a lot more comments than that.  It was over 85K at one point, and is now down to less than 45K.  And I'm pretty sure that plenty of comments had been made while they were doing it.  I'd say at least 50K deleted.  Who did they pay to do that, Strong Bad?"
Beautifully said. I hope you save a copy of this. This is worth reposting when it like all the others here disappears.
"I would have recommended starting with The Hobbit.  The book, not the films."
"Did you end up watching the LoTR movies? If so, what did you think? Also the extended edition of the movies are really great, total runtime for the trilogy on those clocks in around 11 hours but it's so worth it"
"Honestly if you didn't get into the LOTR movies, the novel is out of your depths. It's very challenging to read. This show is going to be nothing like the source material anyways, which took place in the Silmarillion. The narrative is not an actual fleshed out story in the book, therefore everything here is the director's discretion for the most part. And so far, it looks bad."
"Â @InfinityÂ  Tolkien wrote his story in a time of great global turmoil, and with such a time on our horizon, I'm sure it will find new meaning in the eyes of those who did not connect with it before."
"Apparently.  In the comments several people are saying that it was THEIR dislikes that got deleted.

I can't imagine why they would.  No one can see the dislikes without a specific browser extension.  There is one possibility:  too many dislikes might prevent the trailer from appearing in recommended feeds."
"Â @Thomas WrightÂ  Maybe when people refer to ""my dislike"" is because even without the extension the thumbs up/down remains active with the previous selection. I mean. if I chose up or down, it is supposed to remain up or down as I view the video later, even without the down counter.
And everybody seems to have the extension now.
Plus, allegedly, they are deleting comments also. Sincerely, I could bet there were 45k comments when I wrote the orignal comment. Now is 44k;"
"Â @Mustavo GaiaÂ  There's no ""allegedly"" about that.  I have seen it happen.  One minute, there would be 55K dislikes.  The next, only 54K.  Wait an hour, and it woudl be below 50K.  And there were over 85K comments at one point; we're down to about half of that.  But keep in mind, while they've been deleting them, people have been making more comments.  So it's probably close to 100K by now, or would be."
Â @Thomas WrightÂ  Their nexr video will probably have comments and like/dislike turned off.
Â @Thomas WrightÂ  Terribly odd: As I answer you comment it was 44380. I refresh the page and it is 44376
"It's not going to ruin your childhood.  As long as you don't watch it, that is."
Â @Thomas WrightÂ  based your absolutely right.
I wish there were more trans characters
"Just a cute daily reminder: There used to be over 85,000 comments on this video. Crazy how that's magically been almost lopped IN HALF! 45,385 comments as of this posting. This show is going to tank SO HARD, and I'm here for it. ğŸ¤ "

"Terrible. Absolute DISGRACE , DISAPPOINTMENT, MORONIC"
An hour ago the comments are around 50k and dislikes 3.1 million they are still removing the dislikes and comments. I will continue disliking this trailer.
"Amazon can hide dislikes and comments, but they can't hide atrocity that Rings of Power is"
Well this looks like a steaming pile of garbage

"used to be 3.1 mill downvotes, too"
"Â @Christian Heckmann EngelbrechtÂ  Well, you repeated it twice, and it made me giggle, so can't argue with the results! ğŸ¤£"
"Â @Christian Heckmann EngelbrechtÂ  then why do they remove the most rated comment s that are not that quote and all the downvotes and make fake fans and lie to tokiens son. Seems like they just have a hard time with honestly and integrity. Also, it may not be a quote, but it is paraphrase to be more general, although the original quote is to the effect that the one who created them can create no new thing of his own, just mock/twist what is  ( and what was good way made by eru illuvitar/forces of good). It is also  one of the central themes of Tolkien's work which amazon perfectly personifies."
"Â @Lil FishÂ  
""You don't go about editing Tolkien."" That's an actual quote, from the Extended DVDs of Peter Jackson's LOTR adaptation.
Somebody clearly forgot to tell that to Amazon's people, but..."
"Â @Christian Heckmann EngelbrechtÂ  I'm glad you agree about amazon, and they knew wholeheartedly, as they waited for Tolkien's son to ğŸ’€ before they went back on their promise to abide by the cannon, and fired all their experts only to replace them with activists. To me that is stone cold, especially when they choose the memorial of Tolkein's ğŸ’€ to release this. It shows complete disdain towards him and it's about as cold as it gets. 

I have no doubt if Tolkien could see that those who were small, like the characters in his book, like the small ones to make a difference in real life fighting great evil ..like this giant corporation trying to twist and destroy his work he would be proud. From beyond the grave he did make in the past known what his will regarding all film adaptations and how upset he would be if it was like this. What they are doing I wrong on so many levels. To take someone's lifework and treat it like toilet paper, to use and flush...with 0 regard to his cannon or wishes. It's astonishing."
"Â @Lil FishÂ  
Peter Jackson and his people at least tried. And fought against his own army of metropopolis suits that were footing the bill."
Â @Christian Heckmann EngelbrechtÂ  agreed.
"Yes, thank you, I posted a comment earlier today a few minutes after you and I could swear the comment were at 45k. Now is 44k,."

Â @Elle753Â  One is for sure negative comments and bad score in the IMDB.
We lost: 1 500 000.
Lol! How many tens of thousands of comments have they deleted already? It is like trying to save a sinking ship by throwing water overboard with a bucket.
Hope they involve me and Feral Smashing in the Palace's bedroom.

Nope nope nope... you  fucked up Amazon.

Amazon could have avoided all the controversy by saying 'inspired by' and keeping this non-canonical but they want that money

But can't they be very different? Or slightly different? Or rather different?' What we'd like to know is how different is it possible for them to be? Again, the problem is not perceiving where the core of the original lies. Okay, where's the core of the original? Tell us that and then we'll get a bit further forward.""

"you find changing a man's life work, who painstakingly created every leaf, etc (even the horse shadowfax has a family tree) and wrote entire languages and mythologies, to suit a modern agenda rather than writing an original work amusing? I hope nothing like that happens to you or to artistic works you find dear. And yes, i agree for the uproar over the racial elements and making Galadriel a stereotypical action girl and beardless dwarves, to me the biggest problem is how mediocre it looks. that's an insult to Tolkien and means we are dudded out of a good show."
Â @Dom WoodÂ  and how many changes were made for the original trilogy movies or the Hobbit movies? This doesnâ€™t even impact anything lol
"Â @Finrod FelagundÂ  Yes, itâ€™s fiction, everything is permissible lmao, yâ€™all just sound so silly"
Â @Finrod FelagundÂ  ğŸ¤£ you really just typed out 3 paragraphs about this Iâ€™m cackling
Yay! Destruction of historical art! What do we burn next?!

Â @Lia AngelicaÂ  haha it's hilarious to set up straw men and then laugh at them. It makes me feel intellectually and morally superior! -anjelica probably
Â @Finrod FelagundÂ  Doing the Lord's work bud!
"Â @Lia AngelicaÂ  true, especially the Hobbit with the invented elf and the invented triangle, and they were rightfully flamed for it. This makes more departures, so if rightfully flamed even more."
"Â @Finrod FelagundÂ  this is very well put. it is is impossible to film a book exactly, but they had an honest intent to honour the source material that Amazon did not. Amazon should have hired writers and given us a new, rich fantasy if that is what they wanted, not just barbarise middle earth."
Â @Lil FishÂ  you act like Iâ€™m trying to make some profound point or change your opinion. Youâ€™re so ready to defend some dead dudeâ€™s work as if itâ€™s scripture and itâ€™s funny af
Â @Lia AngelicaÂ  no I'm just making the point for the others who might read the thread. I know I won't change your mind because it's clear you could care less...and t's sad you don't have appreciation for or value masterful or historic art.

Read all the books of Tolkien's world when I was 13 yo to now see this happening is a tragedy. I'm crying.
"Y ahora borraron los dislikes a 1,5 millones ğŸ™„"
"Don't cry, my friend!
We still have Tolkien's work that they cannot defile!
Own physical copy of Tolkien's work and rejoice!"
They just ruined the best opportunity we had to see it on screen and itâ€™s sad for future too because of legal rights. How long till we get something that will truly represent Tolkienâ€™s vision? Truly disappointing
See what happening? I'm a bit out of the loop
"Â @Otis De MarieÂ  I think people saw that one of the elves is of black skin, so using their clairvoyance, they have come to the conclusion that the series is ruined. I mean in a way it is bad because Elves are supposed to be pale...but my expectation is super low for this series considering what was done with the Hobbit."
Did you also cry when Peter Jackson took a dump on The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings?
"Â @ReekÂ  You need to stop. The Peter Jackson Films were a love Letter to the Works of Tolkien. Understand this. Creative liberties were taken yes, but the core of what made LOTR was not, that is the difference and that is the dividing factor."
"Â @InfinityÂ  Except we have the Dark Elves in Middle Earth called the Alvari, which is as dark skinned as a black man would be. Tolkien fans should be ashamed. But you know.. I guess Tolien ruined their white supremacy of Middle Earth by including them in there."
"Â @Michael VedalÂ  The Avari are not dark skinned. They were given the term ""Dark Elf"" to distinguish them from the Noldor and Sindar as they did not want to make the Journey to the West. They stayed under the darkness of Middle Earth, instead of the light of Aman. As least get your facts right."
"â€‹Â @InfinityÂ  Well, I guess its open to interpretation, since in the RPG, many of them are dark skinned, but you know.. your milage may vary I guess.

Bottom line is that there are dark skinned elves in Middle Earth, no matter how racist the Tolkien fandom gets."
"Â @Michael VedalÂ  So we are using games as source material now? Your bottom line is baseless as well. In the Silmarillion, we even see an illustration of a Dark Elf and he is not dark skinned at all. He only wears dark clothing."

"Oh, quite worse, actually. They've been removing them periodically. Mine were removed twice. Last week dislikes were sitting at 1.8m and within a day fell to 1.1m.

It felt only natural that an adaptation of Tolkien's work by Amazon would get a few million dislikes.
And Jackson didn't do the same thing? Tolkien would have rolled in his grave when Jackson released his trilogy...
"Â @Kyle DoucetteÂ Maybe, but at least Jackson didn't Made arrogant statements sugesting he Is better than Tolkien."
"Â @David LlamasÂ  What statement? Remember what Chrisopther Tolkien said of  the Jackson films: 
""They eviscerated the book by making it an action movie for young people aged 15 to 25â€¦ Tolkien has become a monster, devoured by his own popularity and absorbed into the absurdity of our time. The chasm between the beauty and seriousness of the work, and what it has become, has overwhelmed me. The commercialization has reduced the aesthetic and philosophical impact of the creation to nothing. There is only one solution for me: to turn my head away.â€"
Who do you think is really behind it?

"Frodo: -I wish The Lord of the Rings had never gone to Amazon. I wanted none of this to happen.
Gandalf: - Just like everyone who lives in times like this, it's not up to them to decide. All we can decide is what to do with the time we are given.

"Frodo: -Eu queria que O Senhor dos AnÃ©is nunca tivesse ido para Amazon. Queria que nada disso acontece.

Wonderfully inaccurate and maddeningly misguided
3 million dislikes wow
i swear there were 60k comments

I just checked and they removed them all

May I reply this masterpiece of commentary?
"Â @ValenirionÂ  I don't know. I haven't seen it yet, so I can't judge now."
Â @ReekÂ  have you read the Silmarillion? lol because then you would know you can judge right now.
Â @Christian BalesÂ  I have read the Silmarillion. But Amazon doesn't have the rights to the Silmarillion.
Â @ReekÂ  i want you to know btw i really do just love tolkien talks so please know im saying this in the nicest way possible i just want to know other peoples thoughts so stay up g.

"look again, the dislikes are mysteriously ""disappearing"""
This doesn't look good at all.
"i feel they should read the books before making changes, the ring was created in the second age, The world was flat till the NÃºmenÃ³reans attacked the undying lands where most of the elves lived Than ""god"" crushed them and their island nation turning the once flat land into a globe and sinking/Crushing NÃºmenÃ³r, i am a fan of the intricate world tolkien created i look forward to seeing what they do with this series, try not to butcher a story & a fan base that has been around for more than 60 years"
"Newt told me that if you don't return his suitcase along with the dislikes i mean the animals you guys will be screwed, even moreğŸ™ƒğŸ¤£"
